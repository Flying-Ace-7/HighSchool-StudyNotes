[[Sporophytes and Gametophytes]]


### Fern and fern allies
- Similar to bryophytes
- Similar life cycle
- Eggs produced in Archegonia, sperms produced in antheridia
- Requires sperms for feritilisation
Im lwk cooked bruv my test is today

### Life cycle of moss
Im lwk cooked bruv my test is today

- Gametophytes are haploid
- Sporophytes are diploid

#### Steps for Life cycle
1. Spores land
2. Moss gametophyte will grow near the ground
3. Through water, flaggelated sperms will swim toward female gametophytes
4. Fertilization occurs
5. Diploid sporophyte will grow from zygote


Also take note of : protonema
(basically a seedling)
- contains one-cell thick fillaments, to increase SA:VOL ratio, increase water and mineral salts uptake


## Ferns
- Seedles vascular plants
- Range from tiniy aquatic ferns to large tree ferns 
- Characterized by leaves called fronds (megaphylls)
- young leaves are called fiddle heads
- Fronds often divided into segments called pinnae(singular: pinna)
- Packets of spores-> Sori (Singular: sorus)
- Dominant phase: Sporophyte; Diploid
A sorus is made of many sporongia(Singular: sporongium)


- An inducium covers each sorus 
- A ring of cells called annules surrounds each sporongium
- As the cells ea;;s of the annulus dries up, they will straigthen up  and cause the sporongium to rupture, ejecting the spores forcefully
- Spores are formed through meiosis



##### Spores released and grow into gametophytes called prothalli
- eggs produced by archegonia
- Antheridia produces sperms



### Seedless vascular plants
-  Seedless vascularnplants include the club mosses, horsetail and ferns
	- Club mosses are found in temperate forests
	- Horsetails are taller stems with whorls of slender green branches
### Examples of fern allies 
- Club mosses (not true mosses)
- Whisk ferns
- Horsetails

### Differences between the 2 groups:
| Fern and fern allies                                                                       | Bryophytes                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Well developed cuticle To prevent water loss                                               | Cannot prevent water loss efectively            |
| Well developed vascular tissues                                                            | No vascular tissues                             |
| Have Lignin and cellulose in cell wallls                                                   | Lack Lignin                                     |
| For most species, sporophytes and gametophytes are nutritionally independant of each other | Sporophytes depend on gametophyte for nutrition |
| Dominant generation: Sporophyte                                                            | Dominant generation: Gametophytes               |
