Mosses are  [[Nonvascular plants]] plants  do not have flowers or seeeds

Peat moss can be used as a carbon sink, can survive extreme temperature


- Only one set of genetic material (n), haploid
- Gameteophyte is N, sporophyte is 2n



#### Alteration of generation

- Hapliod [gametopyte]( [[Sporophytes and Gametophytes]] ) is the dominant stage
	- Antheridia - Release (many)flagellated sperm 
	- Archegonia- Produce (1)eggs
- Mature gametophytes have rhizoids
- Sporophyte is dependant on the gametophyte for nutrirtion


### Structure of a Sporophyte
- Foot, stalk and capsule
- In the capsule are many sporus with multiple sporangium, each contiaing sporocytes that will undergo meiosis to form haploid spores
