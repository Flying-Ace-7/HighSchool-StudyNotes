## Mitosis
A cell "splits" into two gentically identical cells
Same number of chromosones
#### Chromosomes

> [!tip] Chromosomes carry gene information
> They exist as long and thin threads, 
>  [Chromatids]([[Heredity I#Chromosomes]])
>before cell divison, condensing during cell divisions


Haploid -> 1 set of chromosones
Diploid -> 2 sets of chromosone, 1 from mother 1 from dad

for eg:
 2n chromosomes, n chromosones from mom, n from dad

The chromosones in a nucleus duplicate just  before cell division, such that 2n of chromosones is in each daughter cell after divison

Mitiosis is a form of asexual reproduction, no genetic variation between the daughter cells and parent cells


## Meiosis 

Produces 4 haploid cells, usually sex gametes, from a single parent cell.

-> Used for reproduction to maintain constant chromosone number over successive generations produced by sexual reproduction.

More under [[Heredity I#Meiosis]]
Crossing over of genes causes the daughter cells to be genetically different.


## Gene

> [!info] A gene is a section of DNA in a loci of a chromosome that determines a single entire trait.


Somatic cell- normal diploid body cell
Sex cells- diploid gamete cells

Homologus chromosones have the exactly same gene loci
Phenotype- Observable traits


Alternative versions of a trait that are in the same gene loci are called alleles.
Alleles can be either dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always expresses itself in both <mark class="hltr-yellow">heterozygous</mark>(Both dominant and recessive alleles present) and <mark class="hltr-red">homozygous</mark> conditions(Onle=y one type of allele present, int this case, dominant).
A Recessive allele only expresses intself in <mark class="hltr-blue">homozygous</mark> recessive conditions, where only recessive alleles are present.




## Special conditions

### Co-dominance
When two dominant traits each express themselves. 
	For eg: 
	An allele for red fur fuses with an allele for white fur, where both are dominant
	Offspring expresses _both_ red fur and white fur.
### Incomplete dominance
When one allele prevents another allele from expressing itself completely.
	For eg.
	An allele for red fur (dominant) fuses with a special allele for white fur (recessive), 
	Offspring expresses _pink_ fur



## Variation
### Discontinuous variation
- A few clear cut phenotypes
- Controlled by one or a few genes
- No additive effect
- not affected by environmental condiditons
- Eg: Eye colour, blood group
### Continuous Variation
- A range of phenotypes, 
- controlled by the additive effect of many genes
- Affected by environmental conditions
- eg: Skin colour, height



## Mutations
Result of errors in duplications of cells
Somatic mutations arise in normal nody cells and connot be inherited
Mutations can only be passed down if the cells they occur in give rise to gametes.

Some mutations may be dominant or recessive

## Chromosone mutation
change in the structure or number of chromosomes
eg, down syndrome

### Gene mutation
Caused by a mutation in a recessive allele
