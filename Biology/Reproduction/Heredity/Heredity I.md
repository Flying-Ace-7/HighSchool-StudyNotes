### DNA

DNA is made of amino acid bases, A T C G

A pair with T
C pairs with G

Chromosomes are made of [chromatin](https://www.google.com/search?cs=1&sca_esv=4a7abaa8c9d72b6e&sxsrf=AE3TifMm-N5NGG4UQYsBGAZqL2IKOzWqTA%3A1755595092412&q=chromatin&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi30K-uxZaPAxV4umMGHUEzG8UQxccNegQIIBAB&mstk=AUtExfB6_5g1beECj3CfBmaDnPVzFmQa_Y98dUzzm52Ac7RQ7Versfc6uon7nbjd6bb2Q65XTY0Z70eCXHtiiBkaKEvEFTRUdbG20xgBPqlmC3_Ab4aIgBZn0ixWgkZ-hDelnmgLOSYkNNA9ZLj2hhxUnLP3130D11lFc9uSR2vepdzagg_11OsYbkUtc5Tf1P0DBblFF0vJMT48-Yq-Rvv3lpBM9ryKMvYZ0lRiMuTpaezNje6mKRc2GKGKj46u-O0zhU2yVh19638cWnxgCOD0hYrR&csui=3), which is a combination of DNA and proteins called [histones](https://www.google.com/search?cs=1&sca_esv=4a7abaa8c9d72b6e&sxsrf=AE3TifMm-N5NGG4UQYsBGAZqL2IKOzWqTA%3A1755595092412&q=histones&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi30K-uxZaPAxV4umMGHUEzG8UQxccNegQIIBAC&mstk=AUtExfB6_5g1beECj3CfBmaDnPVzFmQa_Y98dUzzm52Ac7RQ7Versfc6uon7nbjd6bb2Q65XTY0Z70eCXHtiiBkaKEvEFTRUdbG20xgBPqlmC3_Ab4aIgBZn0ixWgkZ-hDelnmgLOSYkNNA9ZLj2hhxUnLP3130D11lFc9uSR2vepdzagg_11OsYbkUtc5Tf1P0DBblFF0vJMT48-Yq-Rvv3lpBM9ryKMvYZ0lRiMuTpaezNje6mKRc2GKGKj46u-O0zhU2yVh19638cWnxgCOD0hYrR&csui=3).


In a nucleus, DNA exists as  **Chromatin threads**, and during cell-division, they coil up into <mark class="hltr-purple">chromosomes</mark>


### Chromosomes
A part of a Chromosome contains DNA information that determines a trait.

There are 46 chromosomes in a normal human body cell. Half from Mom, half from dad.
There is hence 23 pairs of **Homologous** chromosomes (a homologus chromosome has two chromosomes, one from mom, one from dad)

```

### Mitosis
During Mitosis, each chromosome replicates and forms two sister chromatids

}
```
Bound in the centre by centrioles
They then line up in the middle of the cell, where each sister chromosome lines up, such that one chromatid is in each side of the cell.

	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
Each chromosome splits down the middle, and gets pulled to one side each.
Sister chromatids seperate and each sister chromatid gets pullef to a different side of the cell, where homologus chromosomes form again, and two genetically identical cells form.
- Produce equal number of chromosomes in each cell
- to produce two genetically identical cell




### Asexual reproduction
> [!bug] What is asexual reproduction
> It is the process resulting in genetically identical offsprinf from parent plant

- Genetically identical cells
	- For
	- Growth
	- Repair and renewal of cells


## Meiosis

A cell undergoing meiosis forms 4 haploid daughter cells, where each member of each pair of homologous chromosomes is inherited from each parent cell by each daughter cell

-> Crossing over of genes between sister chromatids of homlogus chromosomes during meiosis occurs to allow genetic diversity

Produces haploid cells, sex gametes result from meiosis
**Meiosis I**

- DNA replication occurs in interphase (before meiosis).

- Homologous chromosomes pair up; crossing over happens.
  
- Homologous chromosomes separate into two cells.
 
- Results in **2 haploid cells** (each with duplicated chromosomes).
- **Sister Chromatids Are together**


**Meiosis II**

- Sister chromatids separate.

- Results in **4 haploid cells**.


**Meiosis gives rise to haploid gametes, why is this important?**
- To maintain constant chromosone numbers on successive generations produced by sexual reproduction


- Genetic variation
