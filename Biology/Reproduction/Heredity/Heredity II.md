### Gene
> [!help] What is a gene
> A section of a chromosone in a spefic gene loci which contains information that determines a trait


A gene may be represented by an alllele
<mark class="hltr-green">
An allele may be recessive or dominant</mark>\
A trait may be determined by one pair (one from mom and one from Dad) or multiple alleles.


A recessive allele will be masked by an dominant allele in the trait, preventing it from expressing itself.

#### Example
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Suppose the dominant allele for blond hair is represented by B
and the  recessive allele for black hair is represented by b.

Person A : BB (blond hair, two dominant alleles)
Person B: (Bb)(Blond hair, B masks b hence black hair is not expressed)
Person C: bb (Black hair, no dominant alleles to mask b)


We say that A is **homozygous *dominant***, two dominant alleles
B is **heterozygous**, one dominant and one recessive 
C is **Homozygous *recssive***, both recessive allles

Recessive alleles will only be expressed in a **Homozygous recessive** situation



### Inheritance of Traits

Suppose:
Parent A: EE
Parent B: ee

The gametes formed by A and B are: (E) (E) / (e) (e)


One gamete from A will fuse with one gamete from B
Since there is only one possible gamete combination (E)(e)
the offspring will contain the alleles Ee and E will be expressed


Suppose
C: Ee Heterozygous

D: Ee Heterozygous

Gametes:
C : (E)(e)
D:(E)(e)

There are 4 possible combinations:
(Ee)(EE) (Ee)(ee)

There are thress cases where E is expressed and 1 case where e is expressed:

Phenotypical ration: 3:1
