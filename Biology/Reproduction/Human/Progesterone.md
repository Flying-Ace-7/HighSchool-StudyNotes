Progesterone is a hormone that peaks a few daya after [[Ovulation]] and maintains a constant level before dropping, causing the endometrium and uterine lining to shed.

After Ovulation, inhibit [[Lutenising Hormone]] Production in High amounts and prevents ovulation (from happeneing again.)


| Before ovulation: Cells in the ovary | At a low level                                                                                                     |

| After Ovulation : Corpus Luteum      | Maitains the thickenss of the endometrium so that the implantation of the embryo can occur if fertilisation occurs |
