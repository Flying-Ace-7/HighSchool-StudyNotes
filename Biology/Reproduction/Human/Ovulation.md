Ovulation is the relase of a mature egg cell from the ovary. 

## What is ovulation triggered by?

- A High amount of Lutenising Hormone


## Oogenesis
 This process starts with a diploid primary follicle. A high amount of FSH Triggers the development of the follice into a Graafian haploid follicle. Graafian follicle breaks down at Day 14 to release an egg cell into the fallopian tube from the ovary, and turns into a Corpus Leutuem, which produces [[Oestrogen]] and [[Progestrone]]
