[[Follicle Simulating Hormone]]Follicle simulating hormone (FSH) Is a hormone released by the [Pituitary Gland]([[Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone I]]]]).
[[Biology MOC]]
## Main function:

>[!Tip] FSH
>FSH Simulates the follicles in the ovary to mature


## Maturation of Follicles in Ovary (Oogenesis)
There are many immature  follicles in a woman since birth.
FSH Simulates the primary follicle, diploid to develop into a haploid graafian follicle, via [Meiosis]([[Heredity I#Meiosis]])



Graafian follicle also secretes [[Oestrogen]] for the growth and repair of endometrium.

**The egg is ready to be released into the oviduct.**

During Ovulation, the Graafian follicle rupture to release the haploid egg into the oviduct, swept throgh by the fimbria.
^ovulation-FSH-LH

The ruptutured Graafian follicle develops into a corpus luteum, which secrets [[Oestrogen]] and [[Progesterone]]

If no fertilisation occurs, the corpus leutuem breaks down and the levles of Oestrogen and progestrone decreases.


> [!note] Negative Feedback
> If there is a high amount of oestrogen, negative feedback is sent to the pituitary gland to reduce the production of FSH. This causes FSH To peak Before ovulation. [LH]([[Lutenising Hormone]]) release is stimulated by this.
