### Sex Hormones

Males
- Testosterone (produced in the testis)

Females
- [[Oestrogen]] 
- [[Progesterone]]

Common:
- Gonadotrophin releasing Hormone ([[Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone I|GnRH]])
- [[Follicle Simulating Hormone]] (FSH)
- [[Lutenising Hormone]] (LH)


They are produced upon puberty to carry out Gametogenesis:
- Spermatogenesis (males - produce sperm)
- Oogenesis (Females - produce egg)
-> Produce gametes

Gonads start increasing levels of sex hormone (testosterone in males - Oestrogen and progestrone in Females) -> Develop Secondary Sexual characteristics (not essential to reproduction, involed in attracting)

**Mesuration is a cycle of 28 days, and [[Ovulation]] occurs at the 14th day**

On the first ~5 Days, Mesural Flow occurs, shedding of endometrium
