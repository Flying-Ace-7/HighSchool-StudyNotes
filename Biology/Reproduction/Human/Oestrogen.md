| Primary and Graafian follicle before [[Ovulation]] | Causes the repair and growth of the endometrium on the uterus. Simulates the pitituary gland to secrete more lutenising hormone |
| Corpus Luteum After [[Ovulation]]                  | Causes the endometrium on the uterus to grow thicker                                                                            |
