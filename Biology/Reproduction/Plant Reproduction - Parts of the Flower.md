## Parts of the flower

### Sepal
- It is a modified leaf, that protects the flower in the bud stage (young flower)
- All The sepals make up the <mark class="hltr-red">Calyx</mark>
### Petal
cmon you know what it does
- It is brightly coloured to attract insects for pollination
- landing platform for insects
- All the petals make up the <mark class="hltr-red">corolla</mark>
### Receptacle and Pedicel
Receptacle -> enlarged end of the flowe that bears parts of the flower
Pedicel is the flower stalk
_Sessile flowers do not have the pedicel, attatched to the plant directly at the base_

### Stamen
-> Male part of flower ([[#Anther]] and [[#Filament]])
-> All the stamens make up the <mark class="hltr-red">androcium</mark>
#### Anther
Produce pollen grains that hold two nuclei, pollen tube nucleus and Generative nucleus. An anther is made up of two lobes, each containing two pollen sacs, and a vascular bundle

#### Filament
Hold the anther at a suitable position for adequate pollen grain dispersal.

### Carpel
Female part of the flower, made up of the [[#Ovary]],[[#Style]],[[#Stigma(s)]]
All the carpels make up the <mark class="hltr-red">pistil</mark> or the <mark class="hltr-red">gynoceium</mark>
#### Ovary
Containes ovule(s), containing the egg cell and the definitive nucleus
The ovum (in the Ovule) is haploid (n), attatched to a placenta by the funicle (a stalk)
(I do not need more placentas vro what is ts)
The ovule develops into a **Seed** after fertillisation. The ovum is produced by [Meiosis]([[Heredity I#Meiosis]])


#### Style
Connects the Ovary to the stigma, hold the stigma in a suitable position to trap pollen grains.
#### Stigma(s)
Receives pollen grains
After maturing, it secretes sugary fluid to simulate the germination of pollen grains.





**A group of flowers is called an infloresence**
