> [!bug] Pollen Grains
> They are hapliod and they are binucleuic containing the tube cell nucleus and the generative nucleus

[[Biology MOC]]

## The Process
1. Pollen lands on a mature [Stigma]([[Plant Reproduction - Parts of the Flower#Stigma(s)]])
2. Mature stigma secretes a sugary fluid,
3. Pollen grain germinares and produces a pollen tube
	 The tube cell nucleus directs the pollen tube to grow downwards to the ovule
 4. Enzymes are secreted to digest stigma and style
 5. Pollen Tube grows down the style into the ovary, enters the ovule through the microphyle
 6. Pollen Tube bursts, releasing two male gamtes (formed from division of generative nuclues from pollen grain)

Take Note \^^
The nucleus of one male gamete fuses with the nucleus of the ovum to form a zygote
The nucleus of another male gamete fuses with the two polar nuclei to form a triploid (3n) cell that will develop into the endosperm in fruit later.
