## Bisexual, Complete Flowers

They contain both male and female reproductive parts.
They can be said to have 4 whorls (Sepals,Petals,Stamens,Carpels)

## Monosexual, incomplete flowers

They contain etiher male or female reprocuctive flowers

They can be said to have 3 whorls (Sepals, Petals, Stamens/Carpels)

> [!tip] What is pollination?
> Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma
## Self Pollination
Self pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the [Anther]([[Plant Reproduction - Parts of the Flower#Anther]]) to the [Stigma]([[Plant Reproduction - Parts of the Flower#Stigma(s)]]) **of the same flower**. Usually, plants bearing such flowers are **<mark class="hltr-orange">Monoecious</mark>** , bear complete flowers or both male and female flowers.
### Advantages Of Self Pollination
- Only one parent is required
- Beneficial qualities are passed down form parents to offspring
- Not dependant on *external factors* for pollination
- More likely to occur given the proximity of anther and stigma
- Less pollen and energy is wasted.
### Disadvantages of Self-Pollination
Fewer varieties of offspring prosuced
The probability of passing down harmful traits alleles is higher
Hence, lesser resistance to disease is build up, they are less strong.
### Structural features of self-pollinated flower
- Bisexual flowers (obviously duh)
- Anthers and stigma mature at the same time
- stigma is below the anther
- flower sometimes never open
## Cross pollination
Cross pollination is the transfer of pollen grains to the stigma og a flower from another plant of the same speicies.
Plants are <mark class="hltr-orange">Dioecious</mark>, plants **either** have male or female flowers. Anthers and stigmas mature at different times. Stigma's are situated some distance away from anthers.
### Advantages of Cross-Pollination
- Offspring inherit beneficial traits from both parents
- Greater genetic variation
- Seeds that can last longer before germinating
### Disadvantages of Cross-Pollination
- Two plants are needed
- Need external factors for pollination, Like insects or wind 
- Less likely to occur compared to self pollinatiom
- More energy and pollen are wasted.


### Insect pollination vs Wind pollination

Insects
	Insects visit an flower, and pick up pollen grains from an anther. When they visit another flower with a stigma of the same kind, the pollen grain is deposited on to the sticky stigma
Wind
	 Pollen grain from an anther from a pendulous stamen is carried away by the wind, and lands on the feathery and bushy stamen. (by chance)
