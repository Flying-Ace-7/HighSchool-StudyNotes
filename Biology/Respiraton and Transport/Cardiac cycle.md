### Lets go through the processs in detail
1. Blood flows into the [Left Atrium]([[Heart Matters]])
2. The Atrium contracts, Forcing blood into the Left  Ventricle.
	1. The pressure in atrium and ventricle increases simultaneously
	2. The pressure in atria is higher than that in Left Ventricle, until the Closing of Atrioventricuar (AV) valves
3. AV Valves close, Atrium relaxes
4. Ventricles contract
	1. The pressure in Ventricles increase rapidly
5. The Semi-Lunar valves open
	1. Blood enters the aorta from the ventricle, the pressre of aorta increases and  then starts decreasing ( negative of d^2 p / dt^2)
	2. The rate of pressure change  of left ventricle decreses to zero and further decreases
6. The Semi-Lunar valves close
	1. Ventricles relax and preussure decrases rapidly
7. AV Valves open, allowing blood in the atrium to enter the ventricle.
8. The cycle reapets again







#### Remeber the order in which the valves open and close
- *AV* Valves **Close**
- *SL* Valves **Open**
- *SL* Valves **Close**
- *AV* Valves **Open**


### Diastole and Systole

- Atrial systole and Ventricular diastole
	- When AV Valves are open and SL valves are closed
	-  A brief period of atrial contraction then forces all blood remaining in the atria into the ventricles.
- Atrial diastole and Ventricular systole
	- When AV valves close and Ventricle contarcts
	-
- Both diastole
	- During a relaxation phase, blood returning from the large veins flows into the atria and then into the ventricles through the AV valves.

### Dicrotic notch
The aortic pressure increases slightly after the SL Valves close
###### Why?
The blood flowing into the aorta increases and the elastic recoil frothe m the wavy muscular elastic walls of the aorta.
Aorta wall spring back so as to maintain high pressure ans high driving force to push blood forward into the systemic circulation.

**This slight resulting increase in pressure is called the dicrotic notch.**
