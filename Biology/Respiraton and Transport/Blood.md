Blood consists of :
- Plasma. (55% of blood)
	- Water (90% of plasma)
	- Proteins, Mineral salts, Food Substances
- Platlets
- RBC
- WBC

> [!Danger] Function of Blood  
>Â The Blood transports useful substances like Glucose Amino Acids, wastes and blood cells throughout the body





## Red Blood Cels
- Filled with a red pigment haemoglobin, which binds to oxygen for transport
- Destroyed in the liver after 120 daysish
- Absence of Nucleus to increase capacity to carry more oxygen
- Biconcave shape increases SA:VOL ratio , better oxygen uptake
- Elastic to enale cells to squeeze through blood cappilaries
- Synthesized in the bone marrow and broke down in the spleen
- **MAIN FUNCION: TRANSPORT O_2 AROUND THE BODY**
## White blood cells (leucocytes)
- Colourless, no haemoglobin
- irregular shape, contains nucleus
- Mobile, ability to change shape
- able to squeeze through thin walls of capillaries
- Two types:
	- Lymphocytes: Produce antibodies
	- Phagocytes: Ingest foreign particles
	- 

>[!Tip] Main Function
>protective function for Defence as lymphocytes are involved in antibody production and phagocytes are ablt to ingest foreign particles.



#### Antibodies:
They are Y-shaped particles, they can recognize foreign particles , causing bacteria to clump together for easy ingestion by phagocytes
Neutralise toxins produces by bacteria/ virus


### 3 main uses of blood:
-Transport medium
Protects Against pathogens
clotting/ coagulation

> [!Danger] Substances transported ny blood:
> - Digested food
> - Excertory products (urea+CO_2)\
> - hormones
> - Heat
> - O_2

### Transport of CO_2
- CO_2 enter Plasma and then RBC through Diffusion
- In RBC, CO_2 reacts with water to form Carbonic acid, this reaction is catalayzed by carbonic anhydrase
- Carbonic acid further turns into Hydrogen carbonate ions/ Bicarbonate ions which diffuses back into the plasma by diffusion and gets transported to lungs
- In Lungs, the reverse happens to to diffuse CO_2 into air sacs



## Blood clotting
In Damaged Tissue, platelets gather and release   Thrombokinase
Thrombokinase changes prothrombin into thrombin
Thrombin converts fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin threads
Fibrin catches platelets in it and causes blood clotting



## Continued

- Killed phagocytes produce pus
- Antibodies are produced by lymphocytes when phagocytes enter the bloodstream
- Antibodies attach to antigens, cause agglutination
