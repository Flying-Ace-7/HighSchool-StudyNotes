## Our circulatory system
- Consists of [[Blood]], blood vessels and the heart 
- Closed circulation, Blood is always enlcosed within vessels
- Double circulation, 2 pathways for blood circulation
	 Allow for independant contorl of pressure in systolic circulation and pulmonary circulation
	- For Low pressure in lungs to not damage the atrieoles
	- High pressure in body to transport blood and nutirents faster



### Some main terms
- Pulmonary vein 
- Pulmonary artery
- Aorta
- Superior | Inferior vena cava


### Pulmonary and systemic circulation


#### Pulmonary
- Deoxy blood from heart to lungs, oxy blood from lungs to heart
- Low pressure to not damage thin cappilaries in lungs around the alveoli
- From Right ventricule through pulmonary artery to lungs, through pulmoanry vein to Left atrium heart to Systemic C
#### Systemic
- Oxyblood from heart to body, deoxy  blood from body to heart
- High pressure for oxygen and glucose to get to tissues quickly
- From left ventricule to body to right atrium to pulmonary C
> [!Warning]
> The RHS of heart will be on the left in the diagram and vice versa, from now on RHS refers to that of real life, and vice versa


Advantage of having 4 Chambers and double closed circulation:
- Control pressure in each system and circulation insependantly
- fast distribution of oxygen and glucose
- low pressure in lungs to not damage the blood vessela around atrioles



![[Blood Vessels]]
## Types of Blood Vessels
### Arteries
- Thick Muscular walls tp prevent rupture during high influx of blood at high pressure 
- Smaller lumen relative to diameter'
- NO Valves
- the only type with wavy elastic band right outside endothelium
### Veins
Carry blood to heart
- thin muscular walls at blood is slow moving and at lower pressure
- Larger lumen comapred to diameter
- Contains valves to prevent backflow of blood
- 
### Capillary
Microspcopic blood vessels that link arteries to veins
- 1 Cell thick walls to allow permeability to h20 and other disspolves substances
- LArger lumen relative to diameter
No Valves
Blood flow is slow, allow time for exchange of substances


Atrioles and venules are part of the Capillary
