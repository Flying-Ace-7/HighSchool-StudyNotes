#### What are blood vessels?
- Blood vessels are miniature tubes to transport [[Blood]] Around our body, starting from 
[Lungs]([[Respiration II#Gas exchange in the alveoli]]) and to the [[Heart Matters|Heart]]
- There are three types of blood vessels



## The three types of blood vessels

### 1. Arteries
Arteries are the blood vessels that transports the blood with the highest pressure from the heart, specifically the left ventricle
- Has thick muscular walls to support blood coming from the heart 
- Muscles can contract to cause constriction and dialation of the arteries respectively
- Elastic fibre can stretch and spring back, recoil
	Which gives rise to pulse in our arteries
- Contain an eavy elastic band
### 2. Veins
Veins are blood vessels that transport the blood with the lowest pressure, and low speed from the body to the heart
- Contain thin walls with less thick muscular walls (Compared to arteries) 
- Contain valves to prevent backflow
- Skeletal muscles contract to squeeze and constrict veins
### 3. Capillaries
Endothelium is the l-celled thick wall of the capillary, single layer of flattened cells, with the walls being partially permeable.
>[!Danger] Tissuesss FLUIDD
>The blood plasma leaking out of the endothelium withouth any proteins forms the tissue fluid, which exists between tissue fluid and blood cappilaries

- Since the endothelium is 1-celled thick, the diffusion distance for oxygen and glucose to diffuse out decreases, hence increasing the rate of diffusion, allowing more o2 and glucose to diffuse out, while **ALSO** allowing co2 and waste materials to diffuse in
- Cappilary network increase surface area and the total cross-sectional area



### Main differences :

|                     | Arteries                      | Veins                                 | Capillaries                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Wall thickness      | High                          | Low                                   | Only 1-cell thick            |
| Valves              | NONE                          | Present, to prevent backflow of blood | NONE (Cuz why tho)           |
| Speed of blood flow | Highest                       | Lowest                                | low/Mid                      |
| Lumen               | Smaller, relative to diameter | Larger, relative to diameter          | Larger, relative to diameter |
#### How blood is dissemated

Aorta-> Arteries-> Arteriole -> Capillary -> Venule -> Vein -> Vena Cava
