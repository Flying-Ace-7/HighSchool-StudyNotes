## Cellular Respiration

Reasons for respiration:
- <mark class="hltr-blue">Obtain energy to sustain life</mark>
	- Maintain constant Temp
	- Passage of nerve impulses
	- <mark class="hltr-cyan">Cell division + Growth</mark>
	- Muscle contraction 
	- Protein synthesis
	- Active Transport
- To use the energy available in food , Living organisms **Break down** food molecules through _digestion_

## Aerobic respiration

> [!info] Definition
> Break down of food substances **In the presence of oxygen**

- Releases a large amount of energy (32-36 ATP) and  gives off CO_2 and water as waste products.
- The chemical eqn:
	$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}\to 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O+ATP
$$
- Occurs in the Mitochondria


#### ATP Is the main energy currency used in cells

A Phosphate bond is broken to relase a lot of energy


Differences of Photosynthesis and Respiration

**Respiration is the reverse of Photosynthesis**


| Respiration                                                    | Photosynthesis                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Energy is released                                             | Energy is used                                             |
| O_2 is required                                                | O_2 is produced                                            |
| Water is Produced                                              | Water is required                                          |
| **Catabolic Process** (Carbohydrate molecules are broken down) | **Anabolic process** (Carbohydrate molecules are built up) |
| Occurss all the time                                           | Requires light and chlorophyll                             |
| decreases dry mass                                             | Increases Dry masses                                       |

## Anaerobic Respiration
> [!example] Definition
> Breakdown of food substances in the absence of oxygen
> **Releases less energy than Aerobic respiration**

Chem eqn:
$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\to 2C_{3}H_{6}O_{3} + energy
$$

<mark class="hltr-blue">Lesser energy is released as glucose is broken down partially</mark>


### When does Anaerobic respiration occur in Humans?

When oxygen intake is not able to meet oxygen demand (eg. during excersice when muscles contract vigorously and resp. rate and heart. rate increase to enable more oxygen to reach muscles)

	Oxygen debt results, Anaerobic Respiration takes place to provide energy required
The product of Anaerobic respiration, Lactic acid, accumulates during anearobic respiration in cells, causing fatigue

	The lactic acid is transported to liver, where it is oxidised and converted to glucose, repaying oxygen debt


Hence
#### What is Oxygen Debt Agn?
The amount of Oxgen required to remove the lactic acid and replace body's replace of oxygen


### Anaerobic respiration in Yeast
Its slightly different here, where the respiration converts glucose into ethanol and co2 with some energy released

Chem eqn:
$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\to 2 C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2 CO_{2}+ Energy
$$
