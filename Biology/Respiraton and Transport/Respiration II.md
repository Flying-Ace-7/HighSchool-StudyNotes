| Nasal Cavity                       | Hair and **Mucous Layer** on the walls of the Nasal cavity trap dust and filter air intaken. Air is warmed and moistened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Trachea                            | The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of Cartilage that ensure that the Trachea is always open. (Allowing for some expansion)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Alveoli/ Alveolus                  | Sites of Gas exchange/ **They increase the SA:VOL ratio for Gaseous Exchange** / Constant Supply of blood through blood capilaries to transport away oxygen so that the concentration gradient is maintained, mainintaning rate of diffusion/ Alveolar surface coated with a thin film if moisture/ The wall of an aveolus is only one-celled thick |
| Ribs                               | Ribs Support the chest Walls, External and internal intercoastal muscles help with breathing(E.M contracts, I.M relaxes during breathing in)                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### What are some feature of the Respiratory system that speed up Gas Exchange 
- SA: VOL ratio, numerous Alveoli
- Conc. Gradient maintained with consatnt blood flow and extensive network of cappilaries




## Gas exchange in the alveoli
^Gel
- Occurs through diffusion
- The concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood is greater than the concentartion of carbon dioxide in the alveoli, A concentration gradient exists and this allwos the carbon dioxide from the blood to diffuse into the alveoli.
- The concentration fo oxygen in the alveoli is higher than that in the blood, oxygen diffues in by being absorbed into tthe layer of moisture, and diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
- Oxygen binds to Haemoglobin, forming oxyhaemoglobin, to be transported around easily
- Carbondioxide molecules are transported as hydrogen carbonate ions in the blood plasma. With the help of **carbonic anyhdrase**, an enzyme found in the red blood cells, the carbon dioxide molecules in the blood react with water molecule to form carbomic acid. The carbonic acid readily converted into hydrogen carbonate ions that diffuse out of RBC into blood plasma.

## Breathing mechanism in Humans
a. Inspiration 
 1. Diagphram contracts and flattens down
 2. External inetercostal muscles **contract** and internal intercostal muscles relax, rib  cage is pushed up and outwards
 3. Thoracic volume increases, pressure in the lung decreases (as PV=nRT), air is drawn into the lungs
 b. Expiration (breathing out)
  4. Diaphragm relaxes and arches up
  5. E.I.M relaxes, I.I.M contract, the rib cage moves in and down
  6. thoracic volume decreases, lungs are compressed and preddure increases
