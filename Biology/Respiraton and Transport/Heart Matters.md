## Some basic Facts
- Surrounded by the peridicarium, the bag whuch consists of two layers of membrane that surrounds the heart. There are fluids between the layers of membranes. The fluid lubricates the heart and reduce the friction as heart beats
- Coronary arteries deliver oxygen and glucose to cardiac muscles
- C.A branch out from aorta




4 Parts of heart
- Right Atrium
- Left Atrium
- Right ventricule
- left Ventricule
Aorta from LV


#### Septum

Septum is the middle muscular wall that divides the heart into it's left adn right parts, separating th left and right ventricle

#### Left ventricle vs Right Ventricle

The wall fo the the left ventricle is thicker as it has to deliver blood at a higher pressure to the body to deliver oxygen and glucose to the muscles faster, while the right ventricle only has to deliver blood at a low pressure to the lungs so as to not damage the delicate atrieole
