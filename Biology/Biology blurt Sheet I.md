# Respiration
## Respiration In Cells (RI)
### Why respiration?
- Obtain energy for life processes 
	- Growth
	- Movement
- Nerve Impulses
- ~~Breath~~ *Contract muscles*
- Cell Division
- Maintain body temperature
#### How do you get this energy?
-> Digestion, break down of food molecules intp glucose, which can be used for respiration and produce ATP , through oxidising

There are two types of respiration
>[!Aerobic respiration]
>Respiration in the presence of Oxygen
>$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+O_{2} \to 6H_{2}O+6CO_{2}+ATP(energy)
>$$
>Formula for aerobic respiration:
> Releases 32-36 ATP Per glucose molecule oxidised,
>High energy output
>Requires oxygen
>*Gives off CO_2 and water as waste products*
>*Occurs in the mitochondria of the cells*


>[!tldr] Anaerobic respiration
>Anerobic Respiration
Respiration in the Absence of Oxygen
>$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+O_{2} \to 2C_{3}H_{6}O_{3} + ATP(energy)
>$$
>Formula for Anaerobic respiration:
>-> Releases 2-4 Per glucose molecule oxidised,
>Low energy output
>Does not Requires oxygen
>Procuces lactic acid that needs to be transported back to liver to be converted back to glucose
>**An Oxygen debt occurs, as more oxygen is required for the oxidation of Lactic acid**

ATP -> Adenosine Triphosphate


Differences between Respiration and Breathing:

| Respiration             | Breathing                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Intra-Cellular          | Extra-cellular                |
| BioChemical process     | Physical process              |
| Releases energy/ATP     | Requires energy/ATP           |
| Occurs in **All** cells | Occurs in **Some** cells only |
| *Requires enzymes*      | *Enzymes not needed*          |

*Reverse of **Respiration**:  photosynthesis, their chemical energy is the exact opposite*

#### Anaerobic respiration in Yeast;
$$
C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} \to 2 C_{2}H_{5}OH+2CO_{2}+ATP
$$
Glucose is converted to ethanol (chicken!!) and Carbon dioxide and ATP

- KOH Is a base that reacts with carbon dioxide and removes it.
	- KOH is a base while CO_2 is acidic and a acid-base reaction occurs


> [!Info] Oxygen debt is the amount of oxygen needed to remove the lactic acid (convert it to Glucose) and restore the body's oxygen reserve
