So what does Pascal's law state?
> Pressure exerted on a liquid at one point is even throughout the liquid, in other words, the pressure is the same anywhere in the liquid.
> 
- [ Pascal]
Lets take an ideal, piston system,

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.7.9 - 21.23pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```

Since the pressure is the same throughout the liquid, when Force F_1 os exerted on the liquid through a piston of area A_1

$$
\frac{F_{1}}{A_{1}}=p=\frac{F_{2}}{A_{2}}

$$
Remember for piston qn's[[Solid Pressure]]


Also do note, when there is no friction, <mark class="hltr-cyan">work done on the system through the piston, is equal to the work done by the system on the other end</mark>


Also note

## Pressure Gauges

### Barometer with Mercury


Measured in mm Hg, how many mm does Hg rise at certain pressure.

1 atm= 76 mm Hg


### Other barometers

<mark class="hltr-red">Atm. pressure= rho* h*g</mark>
rho is the density of liquid used,
h is  **height above surface of liquid**
