We start of with an intriguing equation(I), that helps derive a more formal equation(II)

Equation (I)[[Solid Pressure]]:

$$
p=\frac{F}{A
}
$$

In a fluid, imagine a coloumn of liquid in the shape of a cylinder with density rho, height h, and g=9.81, hence, pressure at the base of the column will be,

$$
p=\frac{F}{A}
$$
$$
p=\frac{W}{base \space area}=\frac{mg}{b.a}

$$
$$
p=\frac{b.a\times hg\times\rho}{b.a}
$$
Hence:
$$
p=h\rho g

$$
