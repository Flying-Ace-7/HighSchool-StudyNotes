### Convection Currents


So basically in gases and liquids, Underlying thing:

- Hotter fuids vibrate faster, and take up more space, hence density of hotter fluids is lower
- Colder fluids vibrate slower and take up less space, causing the density of colder fluids to be higher


Hence in a fluid :
- If there is a heat source at the bottom of the fluid, fluid there will get heated and rise, and colder fluid settle and get heated, causing that to rise to, forming a covection current


Hence:
