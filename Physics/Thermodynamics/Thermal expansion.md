## Linear expansion


>[!success] Formula
>$$
\Delta L= \alpha L_{0} \Delta T
>$$ 

Where L nought is the starting length, Change in L Is change in length, delta T is change in Temperature
**Alpha is the coefficient of linear expansion**


The coefficient of linear expansion is different for every material


## Volume expansion

The main formula defining change in volume is 

>[!Success] Formula
>$$
\Delta V=\beta V_{0}\Delta T
$$

Where **V** is Voulme, T is Temp, and **Beta** is the coefficient of volume expansion, different for every volumes



>[!Danger] Note
>In solids:
>$$
>\beta=3 \alpha
>$$
