### Conduction

>[!definition] Formal definition
>Conduction is the method of heat flow without any transfer of matter/ medium
>Generally occuring in solids


Basically, in conduction, heat is transfered just through molecules vibrating and transfering their energy to neighbour molecules, until the energy spreads and gets transfered throughout the material.

There are two ways in which this happens:
#### Molecular vibration

Molecules gain energy, and start vibrating more vigorously in their fixed positions from the point being heated, and from colliding into neighbour molecules, transfer some of the energy to them. Through this, energy is spread throughout the material, causing the material to gain heat energy as it gets transfered throughout
#### Free electrons diffusion

Delocalised elecrons (mostly in metals), gain energy, and move more vigorously, hence have a higher frequency of collisions with other atoms, causing energy to be transfererd faster throughout the material


Free electron diffusion > Mocular vibration

**Metals conduct heat better than non metals**
