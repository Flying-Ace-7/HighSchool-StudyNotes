- States that if System **A** is in equilibrium with System **B**, and **B** is in equilibrium with **C**,
> **A** is in equilibrium with C

Or:
If **B** and **A** are in thermal equilibrium with **C**, **A** is in Thermal equilibrium with **B**

>[!Query] CONDITION FOR THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM
>Two systems are in thermal
equilibrium
if and only if they have the same temperature.
