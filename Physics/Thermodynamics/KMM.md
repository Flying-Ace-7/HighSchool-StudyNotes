Model Answer:
[[Physics MOC]]


> [!Tip] Answering KMM Questions, 
> - when there is gas added at constant volume
> 	-There is more particles per unit volume, hence there is a greater frequency of collisions against the surface, causing the **force per unit area to increase** and pressure exerted to Increase
> - When Temperature heated
> 	- The particles gain energy and move at faster speeds. There is  a higher frequency of collisions and there is a higher average force of impact for collision, causing force exerted **per unit area to increase**
> - When Volume decreases
> 	- More particles per unit volume hence there is a greater frequency of collisions against the surface, causing the **force per unit area to increase** and pressure exerted to Increase
