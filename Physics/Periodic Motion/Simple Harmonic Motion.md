## Describing oscillation in a spring system


Suppose O is the origin, the point of the mass in an spring system in equilbrium


let x be the x-component of displacement

There will be a restoring force, say F exerted by the spring opposite to displacement,

Hence, through newton's second law:
$$
a_{x}=\frac{F_{x}}{x}
$$
Let’s analyze how oscillation occurs in this system. If we displace the object to the right
to x = A and then let go, <mark class="hltr-yellow">the net force and the acceleration are to the left</mark> (Fig. 14.2a). The
speed increases as the object approaches the equilibrium position O. When the object is at O,
<mark class="hltr-green">the net force acting on it is zero</mark> (Fig. 14.2b), but because of its motion<mark class="hltr-blue"> it overshoots the
equilibrium position</mark>. On the other side of the equilibrium position the object is still moving
to the left, but the net force and the acceleration are to the right (Fig. 14.2c); hence the
speed decreases until the object comes to a stop. We’ll show later that with an ideal spring,
the stopping point is at x = -A. The object then accelerates to the right, overshoots equilibrium
again, and stops at the starting point x = A, ready to repeat the whole process. The
object is oscillating! If there is no friction or other force to remove mechanical energy from
the system, this motion repeats forever; the restoring force perpetually draws the object
back toward the equilibrium position, only to have the object overshoot time after time.

Some Common terms used to describe Oscillation:
-  Amplitude : Maximum |x| reached during oscillation
- Period, Time it takes for **one complete oscillation** 
- Frequency: **the number of complete oscillations per unit time**
- Angular frequency, omega
	$$
\omega=2\pi f
$$
- Frequnecy is the inverse of Period:
	$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$

## SHM
Finally after an entire yap session:

### Restoring force by an **IDEAL** Spring

Just memorise Ts:
$$
F_{x}=-kx
$$
Where k is the spring constant, different for every spring.
Restoring force is opposite to displacement
SHM is defined when the Restoring force is **directly proportionate** to displacement


The acceleration of an object in SHM is the second derivative of position (x) with respect to time
or in other words
$$
a_{x}=\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}=-\frac{k}{m}x
$$
**An object that undergoes simple harmonic motion is called a harmonic oscillator.**


And through some complicated shit i wont bother typing down
$$
\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$
Trust me in this pls


$$
f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{ \frac{k}{m}}
$$
