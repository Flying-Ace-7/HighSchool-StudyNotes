### Rules to easily identify Oxidation numbers
1. Atoms in their Elemental state have an oxidation number of  ZERO $$Mg \space in \space Metal, \space O \space in \space O_{2} \space etc$$
2. In simple ions, the oxidation Number is the <mark class="hltr-blue">same as the charge on the ion</mark>
3. The oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a  **NEUTRAL UNCHARED** polyatomic ion must <mark class="hltr-orange">add up to ZERO</mark>
4. The Oxidation numbers of all Atoms in a **CHARGED** polyatomic atom must add up to the charge of the atom
5. The usual oxidation number of element is<mark class="hltr-cyan"> usally their charge of their common</mark> ion, like G1 elements have charge and hence oxidation number of 1, thus they can <mark class="hltr-yellow">usually be figured out from periodic table </mark>  
6. Some elements have States that vary based on other present elements, like N P S Sn Pb

### Example Problem:
Determine the Oxidation state in the following, Potassium Dichromate:
$$
K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}
$$
We find that the:
Oxidation State of K= +1
O=-2
let O.S of Cr=x
$$
2(+1)+2(x)+7(-2)=0
$$
$$
x=+6
$$
