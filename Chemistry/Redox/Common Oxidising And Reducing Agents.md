### Common Oxidising agents:

1. Potassium permaganate(VII)
	 KMnO_4
	 Turns from purple to colourless after it is reduced by a reducing agent, can be used to test for reducing agent,
	 $$
MnO_{4}^- + {8}H^+5e^- \to Mn^{2+}+4H_{2}O
$$
2. Potassium Dichromate (VI)
	K_2CR_2O_7
	Turns from orange to green after reduction, can be used to test for a reducing agent
	$$
Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}+14H^+ + 6e^- \to 2Cr^{3+}+7H_{2}O
$$



### Common Reducing Agents:
1. Aqueous Iodine
	$$
2I^{-}\to I_{2} + 2e^-
$$
