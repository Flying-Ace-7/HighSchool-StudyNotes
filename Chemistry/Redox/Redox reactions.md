Oxidation -> <mark class="hltr-green"> Invlolves loss of electrons or oxygen or hydrogen or increase in oxidation state
</mark>

Reduction-> <mark class="hltr-blue">involves the gain of electrons or hydrogen OR loss of Oxygen or Decrease in Oxidation state</mark>

Read about Oxidation state in [[Oxidation Number]]
> Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain of electrons
