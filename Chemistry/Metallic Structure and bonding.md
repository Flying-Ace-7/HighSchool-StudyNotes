### 1. Metallic bond and Giant Metallic structure


> [!Danger] What is a metallic structure GIANT
> - A brief description on metals:
> - In metals, the metal atoms lose all their valance electrons, and the deloclaised electrons exists as a sea of delocalised atoms, free to move around the structure
> - The metal cations (cuz they are positively charged), exist in Layers , regularly arrranged



**The Bond between the delocalised electrons, the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the delocalised electrons and metal cations is what referred to as a metallic bond**

#### What affects the Strength of the metallic bond:
- The number of valance electrons each atom delocalises
	- The greater number of delocalised electrons, the stronger the metallic bond
	- -> The more valance electrons an atom has, the stronger the metallic  bond
- The atomic radius
	- -> The smaller the atom, the stronger the bond
*The stronger the bond, the higher the melting/boiling point*
