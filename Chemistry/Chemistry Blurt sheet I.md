# Acids and bases

Acid molecules disociate into $H^+$ and $X^-$ ions, where x are anions.
In stronger acids, all of the acids disociate, resulting in a hgiher concentration of $H^+$ Ions, and a lower pH value.
IN weaker acids, only some of the molecules disociate, resulting in a lower concentration of $H^+$ ions and a higher pH value.

Hhahahah

Eg of strong acid: HCL
eg of weak acid: $CH_3 COOH$ (Aecetic acid/vineager)



### Acid-Base reactions
Acid+Base:

$$
Acid+Base\to Salt+Water
$$
For eg:
$$
HCl+NaOH\to NaCl+H_{2}O
$$

Acid + Metal:
$$
Acid+metal\to salt+ Hydrogen
$$
fir eg:
$$
HCl_{(aq)}+ Fe_{(s)}\to FeCl_{2}{(aq)}+H_{2}(g)
$$
Acid + Carbonate:
$$
acid+Carbonate\to Salt+CO_{2}+H_{2}O
$$
For eg:

$$
2HCl+CaCO_{3}\to CaCl_{2}+CO_{2}+H_{2}O
$$

Base + Ammonium Salt:
$$
Base+Ammonium \space Salt \to Salt+Water+Ammonia \space gas
$$

For eg:


$$
NaOH+NH_{4}Cl\to NaCl+H_{2}O+NH_{3}

$$






# Mole
~~I love moles~~
Mole is a unit of count of particles like molecules, atoms, and ions.
One mole consits of $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles.
That number, 6.02\*10\^23 is known as _<mark class="hltr-cyan">Agavadro's constant</mark>_


A mole of a certain element always has a mass equivalent to the relative atomic mass(molar mass) of that element, in grams.
For example, 1.00 mol of oxygen is 16.00 grams
3.14 grams of oxygen = 3.14\*16.00 grams = 50.24 grams.

You get the idea rigth?
The number of moles of a element substance with certain mass can be obtained by dividing it's mass by the relative atomic mass.

This also works with molecules, make sure to obtain it's relative molecular mass (by adding up the relative atomic mass of it's elements)

So, 1.00 mol of $O_2$ =1.00 \* 2(16.00)=32.00 grams

Note:
_1 mole of a gas at room temperature and pressure always occupies a volume of 24 dm^3, or 24 litres_, known as the gas constant

So, 1 mole of O_2 gas occupies _24 dm^3_.
And also works for other gases too!!



# Stoichemistry

In a chemical equation, lets say
$$
NaOH+HCl\to NaCL+H_{2}O
$$
We see that one molecule of NaOH reacts with HCl.
We can also say, one mole of NaOH reacts with One mole of HCl
One mole of NaOH produces One mole of Nacl And one mole of Water!!.

So, to determine the mass of NaCL produced when you have 20.00 g of NaOH:

Moles of NaOH: mass of NaOh/Molar mass of NaOH = 20.00/(22.99+16.00+1.008)=0.5500275014 mol
Mol of NaCL=mol of NaOH= 0.5500275014 mol
mass of NaCl= Mol of Nacl \* molar mass of NaCL= 0.5500275014 * (22.99+35.45)= 32.1436071818 g


etc.


hahah

the same method can be used to determine the volume of gases, by finding the number of moles and multiplying it by the gas constant.




# Concentration

The concentration of a substance can be determined by either:
$$
\frac{mass(solute)}{volume(solvent)}
$$
or:
$$
\frac{moles\space of \space solute}{volume(solvent)}
$$

Each however, give a different result in unit mass/ unti volume for the first equation, or mol/unit volume.

Unit volume is usually expresed in dm\^3 and mol/volume is more frequently used. 
mol dm\^-3 can be replaces as M (molar), as this is widely used
t

The number of moles in  a solution with concentration c and volume V can be found through :
$$
n=cV
$$
(when c is in moles per unit volume)
### Dilution
In Dilution, you add solvent to a solution to make the solution less concentrated.

Remember this:
$$
c_{sol}V_{sol}=c_{dil}V_{dil}
$$
As the number of moles in a solvent is always constant. 



# Salt preparation

To prepare a salt, ther are three ways
- Titrate a soluble reagent with another to determine the exact amount of reagents needed, then adding them to each other in the volumes found out previously without the indicator. 
	- When the salt needing to be formed is a Group 1 or Ammonia salt and is soluble
- Add excess insoluble base/carbonate/metal to an acid
	- When the salt is soluble but not a group 1 or ammonia salt
- Add two soluble reagents to produce an insoluble precipitate
	- when the salt needing to be formed is insoluble.
