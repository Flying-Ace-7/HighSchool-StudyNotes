Reasons for British intervention in Malaya: (post 19th century)

Economic:

1. 19th century industrial revolution: Invention of technology and machines that increase product rate and quality. 
    

Therefore, more raw materials are needed, as well as new market to sell the things (saturation is reached in Europe market, where number of things bought become a plateau)

Therefore they need SEA to expand the market + raw materials

Force the people to use them, even if they do not require them.

2. Invention of Canning industries: Tin is needed
    

Tin mines in Malaya become important, as they are the places which produce tin in large amounts.

3. Invention of steam ships + opening of the Suez canal
    

The ships are no longer reliant on the wind, and also cuts down on time, up to 4 months by taking shortcut from Cape of Good Hope to SEA

Due to Suez canal opening, travel time is further shortened to 2-3 weeks.

Therefore there is a sharp increase in trade opportunities.

  
  

Political: 

1. The unification of Germany with other German speaking countries (NOT AUSTRIA HUNGARY IM HIGH)
    

Prussia had experienced soldiers and the first railways in the world, which allowed for transportation. Also, under Frederick the Great, they never lost a war, and had a strong military. Prussia won the Franco-Prussian war, so Germany started thinking that Germany > other countries, especially the colonial powers. (Alsace Lorraine got stolen). They wanted to expand outwards too, so they were a threat to British territory.

2. Rivalry + protect new market + raw materials from Germany
    

It became political the moment Germany rose to power, which gave rise to colonialism

3. Naval bases are required in Malaya to protect the ships travelling through the Suez canal from the increased pirates, which means more bases are required too. Therefore the British needed control over SEA to implement the naval bases.
    
4. Internal reasons like the Larut Wars
    

Conflicts between the Chinese secret societies lead to political instability as the sultans took sides in these conflicts. The access to tin mines and production of tin was disrupted due to local unrest, causing the export of tin to fall dramatically. The British needed to intervene to secure and protect their tin exports, and when Raja Abdullah asked them to intervene, they took the chance and set up a residency system in Malaya, allowing them to control the nation.

  

5. Pangkor Treaty
    

Raja Abdullah is recognised as Sultan of Perak

Raja Ismail becomes Sultan Muda, but receives pension of 1k spanish dollars a month + some territory (bribery)

Raja Adullah must accept a British Resident in Perak

EXP:

The Pangkor Treaty allowed for the British to exercise control over the region by advising the sultans and taking over the processes like tax collection. The British government intervened in Malaya for this reason, as the pangkor treaty allowed them to control and boost the economic potential of Malaya, with tin deposits and rubber plantations. This also ceases previous disputes that threatened the hold of the British over the religion through implementing the residential system.

  
  

Social:

1. Whites Man Burden
    

They “needed” to “civilise” the locals

This is to make them think that Western Culture is better, then they would be more willing to buy the western products, which means more market. Removal of barbaric practices like Debt Slavery. (Started by Birch, abolished in 1884 by Hugh)

2. Succession dispute
    

Son of ruling sultan → Raja di-Hilir: Ruler of the downstream regions → Raja Bendahara: a chief minister who was in charge of the administrative aspects of the Sultanate → Raja Muda (similar to a crown prince or the next in line) → Sultan

Assasination was common, since the only way to promote is if someone above you dies.

Sultan Ali died. (1871)

Raja Ismail (1871-1874) who is Raja Bendahara became Sultan, since Raja Abdullah (1874-1876) (crown prince) did not dare to go to the funeral for fear of assassination. (Weak and unpopular). Need to pass downstream : Raja Yusuf (1886-1887)(Raja di-Hilir) by-passed 3 times since he was unpopular too. Had a stronghold where important waterways were located.

Raja Ismail: Hai Sans

Raja Abdullah: Ghee Hins

  

Sir Andrew Clarke decides this is the best time to act, immediately calls meeting with Perak Chiefs and Chinese leaders (reporting to London takes too long) to decide the rightful Sultan

William Pickering spoke Chinese dialects and managed to persuade the Chinese leaders to settle their quarrels.

Frank Swetterham spoke Malay and persuaded the Malay chiefs to join the meeting.

On 15 Jan 1874, the Malay Chiefs including Ngah Ibrahim (chief of Perak area) and Raja Adullah and the Chinese miners arrived at Pulau Pangkor (island) near Perak. Raja Ismail did not attend the meeting as Ngah Ibrahim did not invite him.

## Transformation of Malaya

### Economic

###### Birch (Profile: Experienced administrator, little knowledge of Malay customs)

“Advisor” to sultan

1. Economic Developement
    
2. Tax
    

3. Perak had a weak tax collection system, heavily in debt, little money in state treasury
    
4. Tax == Livestock, based on villagers (how much I adore you == how much I give)
    
5. Birch and admin collected taxes, in the process removed the incomes of S+MC
    

6. Collect state revenue
    
7. Control how it is spent
    
8. Developed Railways
    

9. The Lines however had little coordination and hence not very useful to improve the standard of living / QOL of locals
    

  
  
  

###### Hugh (Profile: Knows Malay And malay customs)

1. Development of infrastructure
    

2. Hugh allowed for more coordination between the railways through the implementation of the FMS and hence, allowed for faster export of tin etc.
    
3. Urbanisation in Urban centres
    
4. Railways gave Jobs
    
5. Raiways allowed for workers from the rural villages to access town and urban centres for jobs and the plantation for work.
    

6. Usage of advanced miner technology
    

7. Usage of Tin Dredeges: Hugh, with his good relations with chinese leaders was able to convice the tin miners to use advanced european technology like tin dredges to boost the tin export
    
8. FMS Became world largest exporter of tin.
    

9. Standardisation of currency (Straits Dollars)
    

10. Allowed for better foreign investment as the Straits dollars was pegged to the British pound.
    
11. Trade was also easier within and outside of the reigion
    

12. Tax collection system reform
    

13. The sultans and Malay chiefs were given compensation, hence, Hugh received their support
    

14. Land Title deeds
    

Allowed for trading of land, but lead to land alienation as the land ended in the hands of foreigners for plantations and chinese owners, due to fact taht many locals needed to sell their land as they were in debt.

6. Encouraged Foreign investment
    

7. (see above)
    

8. Grow rubber industry
    

9. Introduced the plantation system, allowed for workers to work under a plantation. Lead to higher exports.
    

  

### Political

1. Remove Debt Slavery
    

2. Sultans lost symbol of power
    
3. Birch is seen as a womanizer (also drunkard)
    

4. Code of civil conduct law
    

5. S+MC lost admin powers
    

6. Removed power from Sultans
    

7. Remove income, by implementing the residential system and taking over the most important aspects of their rule like tax collection
    

##### Hugh:

1. Created FMS
    

2. Perak,Selangor, Sregri Nembilan, Pahang
    
3. Allowed for better coordination of railway lines
    

4. 4 railway lines created that supported the development of Tin and Rubbber exportation
    

5. Poorer states could tap into a common treasury fund and grow
    
6. Sultans had power and legitimacy, allowing for political stabiltiy
    
7. Coordination to create and pass important laws
    

8. Perak state council  
    

9. During Hugh’s residency, he created the Perak State Council, which consisted of:
    

10.            Sultan (president)
    
11.            2 Malay Chiefs
    
12. Chinese +European representatives  
    Settled state debt of $800,000 Straits dollars in 6 yrs.
    

=Consolidated S+MC’s power, gave them legitimacy

=Forge ties that were destroyed during Birch’s residency

2. He divided Perak into sub-districts, with each S.D Divided into villages with its own village heads. (British gain control by appointing village heads loyal to them)
    

3. Bangkok treaty
    

4. The Siam Transfered all of its vassal states to the british, which made up the unfederated Malay States. This allowed the british to gain control over the entire region, and boost the economical potential of Malaya by being the sole power and hence being able to exert their laws and policies freely.
    

  

### Social

###### Birch: (Profile: Experienced administrator, little knowledge of Malay customs)

1. Planning and development of towns
    

2. Allowed for densely populated urban areas to form.

4. A lot of diseases spread because of poor hygeine
    

5. Improvement in systems and communication
    
6. Maintain justice and order
    

7. Introduced English Courts in Malaya, where they also removed the power of Sultan’s and malay Chiefs to administer law. The English Courts were baised towards  their own, hence the QOL of locals worsened as many of the times, the judgement was against them.
    

8. Tried to abolish debt slavery
    

9. Debt-slaves were seen as a symbol of power and prestige to the MC+S, and they were removed without much compensation, leading to the MC+S losing prestige and power
    

-> The MC+S Were reduced to honorary positions of religious leaders with no absolute power, and too much power was in the resident’s hands.

  

##### Hugh

1. Introduced Malay legistlators into the court
    

2. Locals had a say in the outcome of cases, hence giving some power to them and ceasing the British power monoploy
    

3. Fully abolished debt slavery, 
    

4. seeing that he compensated the MC+S for their loss and they were able to remain on good terms
    

5. Education Policy
    

6. Increased literacy rates
    
7. Train locals as basic english clercs
    
8. However, only the elits were able to afford higher education, and the creation of the class of western-educated elitests lead to higher demand for european products.
    
9. This lead to social disparity between the ordinary locals and elites, the elites found high-paying jobs while the locals did manual labour.
    

  

DEI

Spices: pepper, camphor, sandalwood (sumatra)

Clove, nutmeg, mace (spice islands)

Trade network with SEA, india, china → VOC (DEI), gain monopoly over spice trade (1619)
