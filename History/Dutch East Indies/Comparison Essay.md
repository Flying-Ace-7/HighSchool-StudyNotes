[[History MOC]]

There are two types of comparison qns:
EITHER: Help all
- Compare reasons of intervetnion of [Brithish Malaya]([[Colonisation of SEA_Political Intervention]]), [Dutch East indies]([[Dutch East Indies I]])
- Compare transformation of colonial powers of [Malaya]([[Transformation of British Malaya I]]), DEI


Criteria for 3 sets of comparison: (3 Paragraphs)
1. Similar and difference 
	 Each Paragraph, compare similar/difference of transformation/intervention
2. Compare 2 (Ex + Exp) 1 For each, brit and DEI -> THEY MUST MATCH
3. You need two times of 2(ex+EXP) to get the highest marks per paragraph

Also Include **2** [Balanced Conclusions]([[British SEQ II#Balanced Conclusion]]):
-> They Can be short, 
eg:

	Both DUTCH and british transformation of malaya and DEI Are similar. The political transformation was the root cause that led to economic transformation as the indirect intervention through the residential system resulted in the economic policies implemented after.

Only need the main idea, no need for futher explanation

### Model

##### Paragraph 1
Comapre Political transformation of British malaya vs Dutch East indies (Similarity)


##### Paragraph 2
Compare Econ transfromation of Brithish Malaya ve DEI (Similarity)
Ex: Railway system in FMS (Brit)
Ex: Railway system within the islands of Java, etc (Sim)
EXP: Access to labour and plantations and plantations -> Increased labour and export
##### Paragraph 3
Compare Econ T of Brit Malaya vs DEI (Difference)
<mark class="hltr-red">Ex: railway sytem - FMS (allow for coordination and increase profit)</mark>
<mark class="hltr-blue">Ex2: Increase profit of x dolla | 3rd highest exporter of R</mark>
<mark class="hltr-red">Ex: Dutch royal shipping line (Coordination across islands to increase profits)</mark>
<mark class="hltr-blue">Ex2: Increase profit of x dolla | same as other</mark>
EXP: The difference is the main reason that lead to higher profits was due to  the coordination between the 4 FMS states tp increase exports and hence profits
While for DeI its is the royal shipping line that coordinated trading ports of the other islands , main islands, BM + netherlands.

**Make sure you have SIM and DIFF**

Writing a dif fparagraph:
1. Same EX lead to diff Outcome
2. Diff Outcome lead to same outcom
3. Diff outcome lead to diff Outcome


##### Two Sets of EX
You cna have EX - EX, and substantiate each EX with another apect of the EX

OR EX-EX EXP EX-EX EXP

where the ex is different
