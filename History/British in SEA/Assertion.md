## Source D Ft. Assertion

*Source D agrees with the assertion*, as Birch's Residency implemented a much more structured tax system and collection (**M**). This increases tax revenue, to build better infrastructure for Perak and thus pulled Perak out of debt/bankruptcy. (Exp.) I know this as "Evd"

This source has a dubious purpose, as the British colonial officer wants the British / locals of Malaya/ International community to recognise that the british colonial rule and justify their intervention and gain their appeal and protection British reputaion/ defend the empire. Hence source D is unreliable and cannot be used to assertion (**_CR ATQ_**)
