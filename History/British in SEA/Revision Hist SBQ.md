# Inference

**Its is the first SBQ Question.**
_yay_

Spend maximum 8 Mins on this question



| Qn Type                                                   | Issue in qn | Attitude | Message | Evidence | Outcome | CK      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Inference (What does Source A show you about Topic)       | Yes         | (-)      | Yes     | Yes      |         | Yep     |
| Message (What is the M of this source)                    | Non         | (-)      | Yes     | Yess     |         | Yep     |
| Attitude (What is the attitude of aurhor towards (Topic)) | Yes         | yes      | Yes     | Yes      |         | Yar     |
| Purpose (Why was this source published)                   | No          | (-)      | Yess    | Yes      | Yes     | No need |
For M:
	identify TA from provenance

For CK:
	Provide a ck **Supporting** the M
	_This is supported by ny Contexual Knowledge which Shows:_

For Evidence:
	Do not copy all things relevant
	Find the best sentence

For Attitude:

	Positive:
		-Supporitive
		- Opptimistic
		- Approving
		- Complimentary
		
	Negative:
	- mocking/Sarcasting
	- Critical
	- Disapproving
	- Pestimistic
	- Unsupportive



Four different types of inference qns:
- Inf: what does source A show you about (topic)
	- Issue in Qn (Topic)
	- Message
		- Show either: 
		- Two Messages or
		- One Message + PEE
		- Note of provenance
	- "Evd"
	- Ck
	- Attitude not needed
-

# Reliability
<mark class="hltr-yellow">8 marks. take ~ 10 min to write</mark>
> [!example] 
> Do You trust what source B said about (Topic)

Remember to CR ATQ At the end of each para
	_Since source is support/challanged, this source is reliable and hence trustable _


### Para 1:
I (trust) As Source B shows (M)+ PEE, I know this as "evd"

### Para 2:
X-Ref to Other Source:
M of other source + Evd 

CK:
Additional details
	Like :
	- name
	- Policiy
	- Like an EX

And finally, CR ATQ
	_Hence, this source is reliable/unreliable, and therefore (Trustable)_

### Para 3:
Critical analysis of Provenance
DP/ER
##### For DP:
Message + Outcome + "EVD"
HOWEVER:
If message and Outcome same as Para 1, dont need to write them,
Hence, some of the cases, jsut O needed

**Make Sure there is an outcome and CR ATQ**

How does outcome work:
When there is an outcome that author wants TA to make
##### For ER:

*I expect to be (Tone/Attitude) Towards (Topic) As Ex
In Actuality, Author is (Opp, Tone and Attitude) towards issue.
EX
Since Author is willing to (sacrifice/lose credibilty) for the sake of (ppl ig)*
Then, CR ATQ
##### For BC (just in case):
Show that author is trying two show both perspectives.
1. show +ve/-ve Perspective
	+ve Message + Evd
	-ve Message + Evd
	Hence balanced, reliable ATQ
2. Show multiple reasons that contradict
	Reason 1 M + evd
	Reason 2 M + evd
Then, CR ATQ
<mark class="hltr-red">It is not possible to have Two or more of  DP, ER, and BC **At the same time** </mark>
<mark class="hltr-cyan">Well nvm, ER+BC can happen together</mark>


# Assertion
<mark class="hltr-yellow">11m - 17 min</mark>

3 Reliability tests at least


2 Yes Paragraps
2 No Paragraphs

For each yes:
	Action: Source _ Agrees as (Qn)(Stand)


Qn: "_British rule was only beneficial to the elites_"

British Rule benefit others also
vs British rule benefit the elites


Y:
	- Action: 
		 Western education system was expensive, and only the rich could afford it.
	- Explanation (+ve impact):
		"EVD", Thus only the rich could be educated and access the  higher paying jobs offered by the British that require western education, improving the standard of living.


Qn : _"British Rule was a mistake"_
Break it down:
-> Unintentional
-> Lead to harm on themselves

YES-> -ve impact on British or Locals
NO -> +ve impact on British or locals

#### Bonus reliability

- Inclued either:
		- DP
		- ER
		- BC
		-X-Ref CK only
Make sure not to repeat the Reliability tests from the first two questions
