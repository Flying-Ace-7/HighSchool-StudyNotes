#### Source B 2024 paper
The merchant wants to prove to the merchant that
- Opium is beneficial, not harmful to the chineses workers health
	Since health is not compromised , and removes their stress
	QOL increase
- The opium is very profitable as there is a high demand

Dubious purpose :
The British merchant wants the British parliament to support the opium trade in malaya and invest in it and thus prevent the banning of opium trade  due to the health issues. In thid way, the british merchant will be able to sell and profit out off Opium trade.

Other things that may be the messages:

	hello im bored


### Reliability scaffold
#### Message scaffold:

(Author) wants (Target audience) to know that (Qn's topic) as (exp). I know this as (evd)
##### Trump M
Trump wants American voters to know that he has legitimacy to be in power as his rule will be beneficial to americans as hr will revivew their economic superiority. I know this as ""

#### X-ref scaffold

This is (supported/challenged) bs Source _ as (Author) wants (TA) to know (Message from para 1 if support else opposite of message from Para 1 if challenge). EXP (BEN) EVD


#### DP Scaffold
Source _ _ has a DP and is thus uR as A wants TA to know (Message)-> Outcome ACTION BY TA.
Author wans (TA) to (Action- be specific tp context)
CR-> ATQ

#### ER Scaffold
I expect Trump to avoid discussing about tax breaks since he is a complicit party. AS (reasoning) this may result in his downfall / being jailed by IRS. IN ACTUALITY (Why saying this has a -ve outcome / better not to say), Trump revealed his deamours in money laundering to expose Hillorey. Hence this sacrificial exposure of the corruption in the USA system was done to benefit and shed transperency for improvement. Source has a ER and hence Believable (CR -> ATQ)
