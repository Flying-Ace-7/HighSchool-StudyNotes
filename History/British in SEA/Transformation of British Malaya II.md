#British 

> Political, Economic, Social Transformation


**After Birch was murdured, Hugh Low replaced him as resident**

>[!Who??]
>Hugh Is a botanist, who first came to SEA in 1844
>He spoke the local languaged, and understood malay culture, very experienced. 


- Sultan Adullah was convicted and was exiled to the seychells

Firstly, review on Birch's Rule
## Birch's problematic rule
1. Sultans have to receive _"Advice"_ from Brit Resident
2. Power to collect tax-> decided y B.R
3. Power to decide law -> Justice
4. Power of debt Slaves -> profit/ wealth / Power .
 All this made it seem like 
 - Birch was direspectful of Malay culture
 - He did not make good ties with MC and sultan

### Problems with the residential system 
- Development in each state was uneven
- Too much power in the hands of the Resdidents
- The Malay states lack coordination
- Transport and communications did not connect with other states.




**

## Consolidation of the Unfederated states

- The northern Malay states
    
- Vassal states of the siam
    
- Increased British fear of competition from other colonial powers, as those stats acted independently and granted concessions to other european powers like Germany and Russia seeking to establish  naval bases in those areas.
    
- 1909 - Bangkok treaty
    

Siam transferred all of its rights in the northern states to British


  
  

## Administrative Changes by Hugh

Perak was divided into sub districts, wi=th each S.D being divided into smaller villages with their own heads. 

  

Introduced Malay legistrators into english courts in Malya, local people have a say now

**Hence power in justice is not solely for the british**

Power monopoly solved

### Tax System changes by Hugh

- The duty of revenue collection was given to the Resident and his assistants
    
- Unlike Birch’s residency, the sultan’s and malay chiefs were given compensation and they supported hin
    
- Laws were passed to regulate land use and register Land Titles. (deeds),  Before the British arrived, most land belonged to the Malay ruling class, as it was a source of income and prestige for them.
    

Tax problems solved through compensation provided

FMS symbolic position of power

  
  

## Economic Reform

  

### Tin Industry

Hugh used his freindship with a promiment chinese leader to influence Chinese Miners to use modern British Mining equipment

  

Production rate improved 

  

Encouraged foreign investment  allowed for continued expansion of the tin mining industry, revenue increased ii

  

> FMS became the world largest producer of tin, from 26,000 tons of atin in 1889 to 70,000 in 192

  
  
  

### Growth of Rubber industry

Growth ofthe automobile industry caused the demand of rubber to increase

The first rubber plantations were established in 1890’s by  Tan Chay Yan, a bussinessman from melaka

European Business men invested heavily and grew the rubber industry

Rubber Tapping usually carried out by indian workers

  
  
  

Rubber became Malaya’s most profitable export.

Total revenue collected: 9 Million (1896) -> 21 Million in (1902)

FMS 3rd largest exporter of rubber

  
  
  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Year|Cultivated Rubber labd in acres|

Development of Infrastructure

- To connect tin mies and rubber plantations to the ports , infrastructure such as new roads, bridges and railways, allowing for trains to operate in towns and plantations opened in 1885 
    
- Formation of Fms  allowed for better coordination of railways lines
    
### Standardisation of Currency:


In 1904, the British felt the need for a standard unit of currency

They made it so that the Straits Dollar is the only Legal currency in Malaya/ Straits settlement


  

  

## Abolishment of Debt-Slavery

  

- Hugh completely abolished Debt-Slavery , by compensating slave owners for their loss
    

The compensation was easily provided  for y the econ growth for Perak

Debt-slavery completely abolished in 1884.

> [!Tip] Note:
 With all these Transformations, The sultans and Malay Cheifs were pleased with Hugh, and gladly listen and take advice form Hugh
  
 
 
  
  

## HealthCare

  

- The British Used their profits from the econ growth of tin mining and rubber plantation industries + knowledge of Western medicine to:
    

- Research diseases
    
- Build hospitals
    
- Put in place regulations on cleanliness of food and working areas
    

- Hence, they helped solve Malaria, beri-beri Rat centipede infestations
    

They eradicated Rats and centipedes, placing a bounty on them, so that people will kill them for the government.

### Migration

The British usually did not limit the number of people coming to Malaya for work, trade and live

- Immigrants from China, India, and te Indonseaian Archipeloga came to malaya
    
- Allowed for plural societies and social diversity in Malaya
