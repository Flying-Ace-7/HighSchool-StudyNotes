Colonial masters : Portugal in 15th century and Spain in 16th century

Dutch 17th

British 17th

French 17th

Germany 19th

SEA: maritime vs mainland

Maritime : Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia (Poland)

àMain focus for the  Europe countries

1.      Pre-19th century reasons for colonization

Why Asia?


		  Spices: Pepper, Nutmeg, Clove,  Cumin

              Money: Profit from trade (not colonization)

              Perfect form: Strategic location à trade routes between China and India

                             Hug the coast or else if capsize, KABOOM. Thus need pit stops.

àPit stops in Malaya

              Motivations:

                             Political : related to public affairs of a country (POWERRRR)

                                           Power == military might

Quantity, Quality (Experience of soldiers+ advanced tech), Control.

àNEED RESOURCES!!! (aka economic)

                             Economic : SOL, QOL of a country (MONEYYYYY)

Takes 3 years to travel form Europe to China (x2 for back), HOWEVER the profit is in millions

Low supply and high demand

If I was a pirate, I would rob at 好望角

àGave rise to insurance : Many people fund a boat together, less money lost.

àEast indies companies founded, become extremely rich.

àRicher than the royalty, threat: Tax, make it national (If a ship sinks and cannot pay up, country takes over the company)

                             Social :

                                           Impact on society, communities or individuals (PEOPLEEE)

Root cause : Power à Need money à Motivated them to secure economic growth

2.      Post 19th century reasons for colonization

19th century industrial revolution : Invention of tech and machines that *increase product rate* / increase quality

                             àNeed more raw materials

                             àNeed more market

Reaches saturation eventually in the Europe market, where number of suits bought becomes a plateau

                             Thus SEA is required.

                                           HOWEVER, SEA people may not require them.

                                                          Force them to.

              Reunification of Germany

                             Prussia : Experienced soldiers, first railways, allow for transportation.

                                           àStrong military, never lost a war.

                             German speaking countries unified to form Germany.

                             Prussia won the Franco-Prussian war. In other words, Germany > Colonial                countries.

                                           Bye bye Alsace Lorraine

                             Also need colonialism, desired to expand. à Threat

              Rivalry + protect new market + raw materials from Germany.

                             àBecomes political the moment Germany rose to power

                                           Gave rise to colonialism

              Social:

                             White Man’s Burden (WMB) == civilization mission

Make them think that Western culture is better à More willing to buy their product, more market.

3.      Reasons for British Intervention in MALAYA (after 1870s)

Invention of Canning industries : TIN

              Tin mines in Malaya becomes important

Invention of steam ships :

No longer reliant on the wind, cut down on time, can cut down to 4 months by taking shortcut from 好望角 to SEA

Opening of the Suez Canal

              Now becomes 2-3 weeks

Hence sharp increase in trade opportunities = increase in pirates = increase in naval bases to protect merchant ships.

Started off as economic factor, now becomes political due to naval bases.

Requires bases in SEA aka take control

Case study of Perak:

How to success the crown:

Rotation system, complete series of appointments

Son of ruling sultan à Raja di-Hilir : Ruler of the downstream regions à Raja Bendahara : a chief minister who was in charge of the administrative aspects of the Sultanate à Raja Muda (similar to a crown prince or the next in line) à Sultan

Only can promote if the one above dies. Thus, assassination. Takes very long for someone to get to power.

Challenges: What if no sons? Out of the royal family

Benefits: The Sultan must already have ruling experience.

Sultan Ali died. (1871)

Raja Ismail (1871-1874) who is Raja Bendahara becomes Sultan, since Raja Abdullah (1874-1876) (crown prince) did not dare to go to the funeral for fear of assassination. (Weak and unpopular). Need to pass downstream : Raja Yusuf (1886-1887)(Raja di-Hilir) by-passed 3 times since he was unpopular too. Had a stronghold where important waterways were located.

Perak has a tin mine in Larut.

Larut wars and Succesion dispute

Hai Sans vs Ghee Hins (originally formed in China to overthrow 清朝 but failed and escaped to Malaya, promised to provide shelter to the coolies)

Over the tin mines. Hai Sans cut water supply to a new mine discovered by the Ghee Hins.

Ghee Hins were defeated, ran to British Governor in Penang, who compensated Ghee Hins. Hai Sans are very angry.

ANOTHER WAR, GHEE HINS STILL LOST.

This time the governor refused to help. Led to the Penang riots in 1867. Both sides were fined 5000 Spanish dollars (a large sum) for disrupting peace in Penang.

ANOTHER WAR in 1872 broke up, Ghee Hins won because they employed mercenaries. 

Hai Sans were supporting and had the backing of Raja Ismail, the current sultan.

Raja Abdullah sought help of Ghee Hins. Promised to give them the mines, becomes a civil war. Economy came to a standstill. Local businessmans asked British to intervene.  
  
“We and our great men desire to settle under the protection of the British Flag.” -Chinese merchants.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Word|POV of Abdullah|POV of British|
|Arbitrator|Advice, suggestion|Instruction, ordering.|
|Settle under the protection|Solve “aid us” (get rid of his enemies)|Live under|

Sir Andrew Clarke decides this is the best time to act, immediately calls meeting with Perak Chiefs and Chinese leaders (reporting to London takes too long) to decide the rightful Sultan

William Pickering spoke Chinese dialects and managed to persuade the Chinese leaders to settle their quarreks.

Frank Swetterham spoke Malay and persuaded the Malay chiefs to join the meeting.

On 15 Jan 1874, the Malay Chiefs including Ngah Ibrahim (chief of Perak area) and Raja Adullah and the Chinese miners arrived at Pulau Pangkor (island) near Perak. Rajah Ismail did not attend the meeting as Ngah Ibrahim did not invite him.

### Outcome of Pangkor treaty
1. Chinese secret societies satisfied with division, cease disputes
2. General order restored= Tin Production resumed= More trade= Restore economy
3. Sultan Abdullah unhappy with Resident interference |Why?=> the resident removed the absoulte power of the sultan
4. Sultan Ismail refused to accept, retained royal regal+ control of Upper Perak
