# Rise to power
*Lenin too lmao*
###### Who is he
- One of the contenders for lenins successor
- Paranoid
- Scheming ehhehehe
- Only trusts himslef
![[Stalin's opposition]]
### Stalins scheming
- Secetary General
- Trotsky weakness
- Alliance
- Look good
- I love lenin uwuw
- Non-disclosure of Lenin's Testamemt
Lets go now:
- #### Secetary General
	- Great power to choose who to appoint in important posts
	- THerefore those who supported him were loyal had key positions in the party
	- Plays a voting game as those who supported him were voted with him to remove opponents
	- Power over CHEKA/NKVD
- #### Trotsky's Weakness:
	- Outspoken and arrogant(Blud thinks he has support from red army(narrow bas of support))
	- His idea was to e in worldwide permanent revolution(boo)
	- Stalin used his idealogy against him and made his own ideology _"Socialism in one country"_ 
	- Uses hate against Trotsky to elim Trotsky hence XX(elinimate political opponenets)
	- DED XD LMAO 
- #### ALLIANCE SIUUU:
	All you need to know, _stalin_ Formed ~Alliances~ and killed and betryaed them
	- He first came up with **TROIKA ALLIANCE** with Zinoviev and Kamenev[AIM ELIM TROTSKY]
		He convinced everyone that trotsky was the bigger threat XX
		Trotsky was seen as Radical(Someone who challanges the system) and was expelled XX
	- Betray Troika and join the moderates(Bukharin and Rykov) Isolate Z and K XX
	- Next _**He proceeded to betray the moderates**_ -> win the support of moderates taht are against his own policies XX(B+R)
- #### LOOKING GOOOD ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥:
	- Creates a cult of personality(Make himself be portrayed as the natural leader)
	- Used propaganda to exaggerate his achievements
		Biased points of view and long term control. He also made the journalists write about him as a hero of the people.
	- XX Trotskyists(Supporters of trotsky)
- #### I lUVV LENIN
	- Main aim: To look loyal to lenin and be the natural successor by the public
		But you see Lenin's Bffs were, Zionviev, Trotsky,< absence of stalin present uwu> so ya
	-  Stalin visited Lenin very often when he had a stroke(and of course banned other members of the politburo from visting him)
	- Act as Lenin's only connection to the world-> his only mouthpeice to the world
	- **Organized Lenin's Funeral and made it _Grande af_** 
	- Rename PetroGrad->LeninGrad(In honour of Lenin ofc)
	- Estalished himself as  **_Cheif mourner_** 
		Becomes closely associated with Lenin and BECOMES SEEN AS THE **_NATURAL SUCCESSOR_** to Lenin(Tick-Tick)
	- Act against Trotsky:
		Blud gave trotsky the wrong date for the funeral and thus Trotsky didnt turn up for the funeral(Rem he was expelled from the party). Hence the politburo thought Trotsky was too proud and did not bother to respect Lenin. He lost more support XX
- #### Non-disclosure of Lenin's Testament
	- **_Lenin's testament Critisced many Politburo members, such as, Bukharin and zionev, Stalin, and Kamenev_**
	- Hence, if it got out, stalin will be forced to step down
	- However, he manages to convince other politburo members to not disclose the testament
	- ## AND HENCE STALIN REMAINS AS SECRATERY_GENERAL
	- So ye(Tick,tick)
