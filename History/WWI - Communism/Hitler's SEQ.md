## Hitler's rise to power was due to more Favourable circumstances
#### Yes paragraphs:


Yes, I agree that Hitler orse to power due to favourable political circumstances caused by the weimar governmnat. 
1. Due to the structural weaknesses of the weimar governemnt, wherby proportional reepresentation was practiced , this resulted in manay different parties, participating in elections and the formation of many different small parties. In order to form a majority, many of the small parties, formed coalition governments, and the weimar government had to deal and contend with 20 diffenerent coalition governments. It was very difficult to make decicsions efficiently
2. Weimar government was also extremely unpopular as they signed the armstice ant the TOV which was  a Diktat forcing germnay to pay warreparations of 6.6 billion pounds etc etc[Tov Terms] This resulted in the destruction of germany's economy and caused the loss of many people's jobs.
3.

EXP: Hence hitelr's promise for a strong fascist givernment would appeal to the germans who were tired and weary of from the terrible decision making and weakness of the Wimar government. Hence his solutions for their problems led tpo the germans Supporting Hitler and helping rise to power, especially the working class who lost the most during the economic crisis.






#### No paragraphs
No I disagree as Hitler was able to atract support with his charisma and oratorical skills in proprogating his nazi ideology:

1. Hitler mainly gained support from germans by speaking in beer  halls and propogated the idea and descried the problems faced by germans with solutions of taking over, explaining that the root causes as the weakness of the weimar government and the Jews, both of whom were particularly hated by the Germnas to relate to his ideas, especially since most of tem were drunk and empotionaly moved by his speeches , Hitler was able to receieve much suppport from the German working class who frequented the beer halls.
2. Hitler's speeches were seen as relatable as he spoke about the problems of the Ruhr crisis and Great depression, and pinpointed the blame to the Weimar government/s lack of intervence and reliance on USA.
3. Hence his promises of a strong government and overturing the TOV through the rearmamnet, expansion to gain Lebensraum, Autraky and creation of Aryan master race, particualryly appealing to te germnans.
EXP: Hence the promises targeted the worse of the germans which resulted in broadband support for Hitler especialy since he was able to convince through his Charismatic speeches. 


## Balanced conclusion
##### How?
Suppose the paras are
1.Econ cir(Yes)
2.Political cir(Yes)
3.Charisma(No)

Refer to notes and [[FREAKY HITLER]]
- Root cause (Factor1->Factor 2)
	- Suppose Econ Circumstances led to the support through Charisma
	- Stand: Economic circumstance(_Factor 1_) is more significant in Hitler's rise to power as it is the *Root cause* to hitler's Charisma in gaining support for his Nazi ideology(_Factor 2_)
	- Explain([How did Factor 1 lead to Factor 2]): Due to the hardships caused by the harsh economic crisis of the ruhr crisis and the Great Depresion, the germans suffered greatly through the drastic drop in their Quality of Life which lead to Hitler's ideologies becoming more relevant and more attractive in solving their issues. Therefore, the impacts of the great depression caused Hitler's promises of _Aurtaky_ and strong governance for a greater Germany to be attractive, making his arguments valid.
