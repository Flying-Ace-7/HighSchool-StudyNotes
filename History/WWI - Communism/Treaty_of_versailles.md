## After the end of WW1 #ww1
Germany had to accept defeat _Oh no Im cookedðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥_
Hence the treaty of Versailles was came up with:
### Main aims of TOV:
* Collective security
* World peace
The superior powers(Usa,Uk,France) wnated to pin the entire cause of war on germany
Hence the war Guilt clause 231 was written and Germany has to accept. The Clause entails:
_"Germany has to take full responsibilty for the war and hance pay war reparations of 6.6billion pounds(roughly 6.6 Trillion today)"_
so yay...
Other important terms of war:
* No airforce
* Disarm to 100k Soldiers in army
* No [Conscription](https://www.google.com/search?q=defintion+of+conscription&rlz=1C1GCGD_enSG1097SG1097&oq=defintion+of+conscription&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAtIBCDUzMzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-)
* No Anschluss(reunification with Austria hungary)
* Remove all overseas colonies in Africa and asia
* Alsace-Larraine to be given back to france
* Demilitarize Rhineland and saar(later occupied by france) and Danzig
