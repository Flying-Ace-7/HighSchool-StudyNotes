### ✅ **Opening**:

**“In my view, no — a country cannot fully achieve modernisation without sacrificing some part of its natural environment. However, the extent of this sacrifice _can_ be managed and reduced if we act responsibly. Singapore is a strong example of how we can try to strike that balance, even if challenges still remain.”**

### 📌 **Substantiated Argument**:

Modernisation often requires building more homes, hospitals, transport infrastructure, and industries. In land-scarce countries like Singapore, this puts direct pressure on forests, green spaces, and biodiversity. **Article B** discusses how areas like the <mark class="hltr-orange">Tagore and Mandai forests — home to endangered species like the Raffles’ banded langur — are still being considered for housing. </mark> This shows that development often comes at the expense of natural habitats.

But there are efforts to **mitigate** these sacrifices. As **Mr Lim Liang Jim from NParks mentions in Article C(ii)**, Singapore has committed to protecting 7,800 hectares of green space and adding another 1,000 hectares in the next 10 to 15 years. Initiatives like **ecological profiling** and creating **nature park networks** around reserves help reduce damage, but they don't erase it entirely.

Even NGOs like **ACRES (Article E)** face limitations due to land constraints, needing more space for rescue and rehabilitation. The article highlights how land issues delayed their wildlife sanctuary for over a decade, showing how environmental goals often take a backseat.

So while **modernisation almost always requires trade-offs**, we can **reduce the negative impact** through strong environmental laws, responsible planning, and community action. But the truth remains — **something is always lost**. The key is making sure what’s lost is not _irreversible_.




## Opening
“I personally don’t think a country can achieve modernisation without sacrificing its natural environment. However, I believe the damage can be _minimised_, not completely avoided. There will always be trade-offs — especially in urban cities like Singapore where land is extremely limited — but with responsible planning, innovation, and public involvement, we can reduce the extent of harm.”

## Args
Modernisation isn’t just about buildings and roads — it includes better public healthcare, transport systems, education, and economic growth. But achieving these comes with land use, pollution, and habitat loss.

A strong example is **Singapore’s Tagore forest** mentioned in **Article B**. It is a critical habitat for the **Raffles’ banded langur**, a species that only exists in Singapore and Malaysia. Yet, that forest is being considered for housing. This shows how urban development often takes priority — and **biodiversity suffers as a result**.

Another case is **Article E**, where **ACRES** — a major wildlife rescue NGO — had their entire 1.5-hectare sanctuary ruined due to **land poisoning by a contractor**. For over 15 years, they couldn’t expand, even though the number of rescued animals kept rising. That shows how even well-meaning conservation efforts are blocked by poor land-use practices and competing priorities.

Even globally, look at Jakarta, Indonesia — it's modernising but sinking due to over-extraction of groundwater and destruction of natural wetlands. The government is now building a new capital (Nusantara), but in doing so, it's clearing **rainforests** and displacing **indigenous wildlife and communities**.

### ## **Mitigation Measures – They Help, But Don’t Erase the Problem**:

Singapore _has_ taken steps to **mitigate these losses**, like the **SGBioAtlas app** (Article A), which lets citizens record wildlife sightings, helping scientists map biodiversity. There's also **green infrastructure** like **eco-link bridges**, **vertical gardens**, and even park connectors. NParks also mentioned the **Nature Conservation Masterplan**, which uses science-based approaches to protect habitats.

But these are just **damage control**. Article C(i) rightly questions whether Singapore is truly a “City in Nature” — or whether we’re just inserting nature into an urban framework. We still **treat nature as a tool** — something to clean our air or reduce stress — instead of recognising its **intrinsic value**.

### 📣 **Call to Action + Social Layer**:

To move forward, we must stop seeing nature and development as separate. More policies should **mandate Environmental Impact Assessments**, as suggested in Article B. We need more buffer zones, as **Dr. Shawn Lum** mentions in Article E, and spaces where animals can recover without becoming dependent on humans. Even citizens can help — from joining groups like **Friends of the Parks**, to advocating online, like **WWF's Ms Uma Sachidhanandam** advises in Article A.

### 🔄 **Peer Engagement (Optional Finish)**:

“So I’d say: no, modernisation will always cost us something environmentally. But _how much_ we sacrifice — that’s still in our control. What do you all think — do you believe these mitigation efforts are enough? Or are they just a way to justify more development?”


### Article B
These include the critically endangered Raffles’ banded langur, a native leaf-eating monkey that can be found only in Singapore and Malaysia. The Tagore forest, one of its habitats, is slated for housing at the moment. Since the [birth of a baby of the species in the past few months,](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/local-raffles-banded-langur-population-welcomes-new-male-infant) the population of these monkeys here stands at 76.
