Cosine really is just
$$
\cos \theta= \frac{adj}{hyp}
$$
<mark class="hltr-orange">Adjacent Side divided by hypotenuse</mark>

In a circle:
$$
\cos \theta=\frac{x}{r}
$$
In a unit circle,
$$
\cos \theta=x
$$
where x is the x value of the point of intersction between the circle and line with an angle of theta with the **positive x axis**
