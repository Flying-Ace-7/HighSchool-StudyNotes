Take the Following case for eg,

(Lets call it the first type)

| Variable x | Freq. |
| ---------- | ----- |
| 0>x>=10    | 11    |
| 10>x>=20   | 23    |
| 20>x>=30   | 58    |
The class limits in this case,
where it is expressed in the form of
$$
a>x\geq b
$$

The **Class LIMIT** will be a and b,
where:
- **a is the LOWER class Limit**
- **b is the UPPER class limit**


### HOWEVER

When data is expressed like this:
(Call it second type)

| Variable x | freq |
| ---------- | ---- |
| 0-9        | 10   |
| 10-19      | 23   |
| 20-29      | 42   |
Expressed in te form of:
$$
a-b
$$
The class limits are still a and b,

where:
- **a is the LOWER class Limit**
- **b is the UPPER class limit**


### Class Boundaries

IN GENERAL, 
= the upper class boundary  of any class

= lower class boundray of the next class
=(upper class limit of the class + lower class limit of next class)/2

#### Hence, for the first type of grouped data,
Upper class limit=b
lower class limit=a

#### For the second type
let the next class be
$$
c-d
$$
and the previous class
$$
e-f
$$
upper class limit=(b+c)/2
lower class limit=(a+f)/2
