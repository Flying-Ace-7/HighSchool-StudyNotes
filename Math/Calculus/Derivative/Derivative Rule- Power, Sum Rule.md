A general Rule to compute Derivatives

$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}

$$



For Example

#### Qn(a): Find the formula that is the gives the derivative for x^2 

$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x^1=2x
$$
#### Qn(b): Find the slope of a line tangent to the curve of x^2 at 2
$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x
$$
Sub in x=2

$$
2x= 2*2=4

$$
**Ans=4**


<mark class="hltr-green">We can hence use this rule  to find derivatives of polynomials</mark>, with Sum rule and constant rule,
## Constant Rule
its kind of trivial
$$
\frac{d}{dx}cx=c (\frac{d}{dx}x)
$$
where c is a constant number,

<mark class="hltr-blue">Also, the derivative of a constant is 0</mark>

#### Problem, find the derivative of 2x^2 :
$$
\frac{d}{dx}2x^2=2 \frac{d}{dx}x^2=2*2x=4x
$$



### Well, What is sum rule?
The Sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is equal to the derivative of its parts summed up,(i think), goes like this:

#### Problem, find the derivative of 2(x^2)+3(x)+2
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2+3x+2)= 2 \frac{d}{dx}x^2+3 \frac{d}{dx}x+\frac{d}{dx}2=2(2x)+3(1)+0=4x+3
$$
