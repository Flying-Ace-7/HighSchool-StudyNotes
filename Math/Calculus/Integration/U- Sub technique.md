Theres this really, useful techinque here, substitution rule
$$
\int f(g(x)) g'(x) dx= \int f(u) du
$$

where you set 
$$
u=g(x)
$$



This conscices integration, and makes it easier to deal with stuff.

### Example (1)

$$
\int (2x+3)(\sin ((x^2+3x)) dx

$$

In this case, let


$$
u= x^2+3x
$$

Notice that,
$$
du=2x+3 dx
$$
hence,
The integral above is equal to:

$$
\int \sin(u) du=-\cos(u)+c=-\cos(x^2+3x)+c
$$


Trys to this in your head soon, this is key for other problems




$$
\int^{}_{}
$$
