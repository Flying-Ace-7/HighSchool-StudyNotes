$$
\int^\pi_{2e}ci\pm em+f(g'(d\text{"(x)}))
$$
Random shit above

Anyways, finding a integral, is finding the antiderivative of a function,
i.e what function has this derivative been taken of.

#### Example problem 1:
###### Let,
$$
f'(x)=F(x)
$$
##### then, is F(x) is defined, what is f(x)?
Let: 
$$
F(x)=x^2+3x+2

$$





### KC: An inetgral, gives the singed area under the graph of a function, the area function is the antiderivative of the integrad(function you are integrating)

Hence, using that, since the area under the graph for eg, a velocity-time graph, you can integrate it to get displacement
