What are Vectors?

Well, there are two perspectives one uses
-  Vectors are arrows pointing in space, from one point, applicable in physics
- Vectors are ordered arrays, applied in CS, similar to [[Matrices]]

Well, lets take a look at vectors used in physics,

In a Free body diagram that is


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.7.27 - 15.07pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```


Here, there are 4 vectors, each of its 'Tail' lies on the point mass ( #massive )
They each represent a force, and are in different directions.

>[!define] So what are vectors really?
Its a quantity with both direction and magnitude

So for example, a force is a vector quantity, with both direction and a magnitude
- A 1 N force applied to the left is not the same as a 1N force applied upward


A Vector pointing from O towards A maybe represented by:
$$

\vec{OA}
$$
And, say it has a length of 5 unitd, then, its modulus or **Magnitude** will be:
$$
|\vec{OA}|=5u
$$
> [!success] Vectors can be represtned as directed line segments in a diagram


### Equal vectors
If two Vectors have the same magnitude and direction, they are said to be equal

### Negative vectors

Two vectors having the same magnitude but **Opposite directions** are negatives of each other


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.7.27 - 15.18pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```



>[!Note] Scalars
>Scalars are quantities without any direction 
>Eg. :
>-  Mass
>- Temperature
>- Refractive index


## Scalar Multiplication

Let k= a real number, k is a scalar

let OA be a vector

$$
k \times \vec{OA} = k (\vec{OA})
$$
Where the direction of the product vector is reversed if k<0


$$
|k \vec{OA} |= k|\vec{OA}|
$$

The Direction is the same as long as K>0



## Vector Addition
Its better to show ts:

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.7.27 - 15.34pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```


There are 4 Vectors:
$$
\vec{OA},\vec{AB}, \vec{BC}, \vec{OC}
$$

Here:
$$
\vec{OC}=\vec{OA}+\vec{AB} +\vec{BC}
$$

Where the **Resultant Vector** = OC
