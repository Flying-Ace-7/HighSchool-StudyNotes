## 1. Bisecting Chords

Lets draw a diagram to illustrate this rule:

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 17.36pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
-> O is the centre of the circle woth some radius. AB is a chord, and x is a point along the chord.
 When OX is perpendicular to BA, OX bisects BA at X, hence X becomes the midpoint for BA

When X is the midpoint for BA, OX Bisecting BA, OX is perpendicular to BA.

When a point P exists, and PX bisects BA and is perpendicular to BA, Line PX will pass through the centre of the circle. *(Not line segment PX)* 



## 2. Theta at centre = 2 theta_1 at circumference


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 17.46pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
Let there be a circle centered at O, DC and AB are chords of the circles. Pount Y is the midpoint of AB, Point X is the midpoint of DC. If X and Y are eqidistant from O, (i.e Line OX = line OY and OX is perpendicular to AB, OY is Perpendicular to DC), DC=AB.


## 3. Angles in same segment


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 17.52pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
AB Is a chord on a circle, and C and D are points on the major arc AB. 
$$
\angle ACB= \angle ADB
$$

## 4. Right angle in a semi circle


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 17.55pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
Let AB be the diameter of a circle, point D on the arc AB. then, 
$$
\angle ADB =90 \degree
$$
This condition is always true in a semicircle, AB is the diameter.

## 5. Angle at Centre = 2 Angle at circumfrence

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 17.58pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```


A circle here is centered at O, and B and A are points on the circle. Let C be a point on major arc BA. then,
$$
\angle BOA = 2 \angle BCA
$$

If C is a point on the minor arc BA:

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 18.02pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
Then:
$$
reflex  \angle BOA =2 \angle BCA 
$$

## 6. Cyclic Quadilaterals

Cyclic quadliaterals are quadilaterals in which their points all lie on a circumference of any circle (ie same distance away from a point)

For eg:


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.10 - 18.07pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```

A,B,C,D Are points which lie on a circle  centered at O, they are all the same distance away from O.

ABCD is a cyclic Quadilateral.

In a cyclic quadilateral, the following occcurs:

Opposite angles are supplementary:
	In this case: $$
\angle ABC + \angle ADC= 180\degree
$$
	And the same relationship applies for the other pair of opposite angles
Hence, if one side is extended, the exterior angle is equal to the opposite angle
	That may not be very clear. Take a look in thic case. Let AD be extended beyond D to a point X. 
	$$
\angle CDX= \angle ABC, as \angle CDX+ \angle ADC= 180 \deg
$$
## 7. Perpendicular tangents

A tangent at a Point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius from the centre of the circle to that point

For eg.:

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 12.28pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
YX is the diameter of a circle centerd at O, and BA is tangent to the circle at point X, then, $OX \perp  BA$ .


## 8. Tangent from ext. point

Let there be a circle centered at O, and two points on the circle A and B. There are two tangents passing through A and B respectively, and they meet at point X. 
Then,
AX=BX, $\angle OAX=\angle OBX$


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 12.42pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```


Why?

$\triangle OAX \cong \triangle OBX$

see if you can spot it for yourself as an exerceise , Using [[Congruency Tests]]

(Hint: [RHS Property]([[Congruency Tests#RHS property]]))



## 9. Alternate Segment Theorem.

>[!Tldr] The proper Definition
>The angle which a chord makes woth a tangent at its point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment


Let there be Line XY, tangent to a circle centered at O at point A. and a chord BA.
Angle BAX = to Angle BPA where P is **any** point on the arc AB, given that the arc is further away from X than it's complementary arc.


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 13.33pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
