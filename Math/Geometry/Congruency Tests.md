We say that two traingles are congurent if they are the same (same sides, same angles. They can be rotated too) ^cong

## SSS Property

If Two Triangles' corresponding sides are equal, the triangles are congurent:

Let there be two Triangles, ABC and DEF
AB=DE
BC=EF
CA=FD
hence, through SSS Property
$$
\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF
$$

(Note, the order of points listed is important. Here, Point A corresponds to point D on the second triangle and so on, that is not the same as saying Point a corresponds to point F)

}
```

## SAS

If two given sides and the inculded angle between them are equal to the corrseponding two sides and included angle, the triangles are congurent.


For example:


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 13.49pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```

## ASA property

Two given angles and the included side is equal to the corresponding two angles and included side, we asay then the two triangles are congurent.

```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 13.52pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```

## AAS property

Same as ASA Property, excpet that the side is non-included:


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 13.54pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```

## RHS property

This can only be used to test for congurency between right-angled triangles.
When the hypotenuses and one corresponding sides are equal, they can be said to be congurent,


```handdrawn-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.3.4",
	"filepath": "Ink/Drawing/2025.9.13 - 14.04pm.drawing",
	"width": 500,
	"aspectRatio": 1
}
```
> [!Warning] SSA Property
> THIS PROPERTY **CANNOT** BE USED TO TEST CONGURENCY
> Why?
> An non-included angle may result in two triangles being able to be drawn from two given sides and a non-included angle.
